Abstract = {Slope failures frequently occur in open-pit mines, resulting in
   significant losses. Identifying the precursory displacements and
   triggering factors for detecting unstable slopes is critical for
   reducing and preventing their impact. This study proposes combining
   satellite radar interferometry and infrared thermography with numerical
   simulation to determine unstable slopes in an open-pit mine. First,
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is utilized to capture
   deformation information in a line-of-sight direction in terms of
   velocity to locate the long-time movement on a large scale. The
   application of infrared thermography enables the detection of peculiar
   features based on the different thermal patterns occurring along the
   slope and the interpretation of critical sectors matching with the
   instability zones highlighted by the InSAR. In particular, areas with
   various surface temperatures were associated with vegetated spots, new
   benches, bare sectors, and contact between different lithologies. By
   means of three-dimensional stability analyses, the associated
   interferometry movement confirmed the slope instability, and a critical
   failure surface was found using two-dimensional numerical simulation.
   The efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through a massive
   slope failure in the Qidashan open-pit mine in Liaoning, China. It
   predicts the slope failures caused by intense rainfall and reveals the
   progressive failure mechanism. The practical application has
   demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach for
   detecting failure precursors, providing a novel procedure for remotely
   identifying critical slopes in an open-pit with frequent mining
   activity.},

Title = {Unveiling unknowns: Practical application of InSAR for slope performance
   monitoring and risk management across multiple surface mines},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {293},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The ability to monitor and predict slope failures in a surface mining
   setting is paramount for safely executing economically feasible open pit
   slope designs. Ground-based monitoring systems have proven to be
   effective for decades; however, with the geographical extensive nature
   of some mineral deposits, multiple open pit mining operations typically
   incur additional challenges of deploying and maintaining ground-based
   systems (compared with a single, large open pit). Monitoring strategies
   in the 2020s have significant opportunity to integrate satellite based
   InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) as part of the control
   measures depending on the expected failure mechanisms and risk profile.
   This paper uses case studies to explore the practical application of
   InSAR to `unveil unknowns' for multiple open pit mining operations where
   ground monitoring capacity was previously constrained. Case studies
   include the retrospective analysis of historic slope failures, improving
   understanding of existing geotechnical hazards and improving engineering
   geological and slope stability models based on real slope performance
   data.},

Title = {Development of an early-warning time-of-failure analysis methodology for

Abstract = {The recent introduction of ground-based slope stability radar in
   open-pit mines to complement conventional geodetic monitoring programs
   provides near real-time deformation measurements over a broad coverage
   area; this allows geotechnical engineers to observe the spatial
   distribution of pit wall movements and their progression over time. This
   paper presents a newly proposed early warning time-of-failure (TOF)
   analysis procedure for use in real-time with ground-based radar
   measurements designed to be integrated in an open-pit mine's trigger
   action response plan (TARP). The inverse-velocity and slope gradient
   (SLO) TOF analysis methods are applied to radar displacement
   measurements using a new systematic multi-pixel selection technique
   termed the ``percent deformation method.{''} The utilization of the
   percent deformation method in the proposed real-time TOF analysis
   methodology gives more-reliable results than current practice by
   providing recommendations for pixel selections, data filtering, where
   and how to undertake TOF analyses, and presenting TOF results in real
   time. The addition of a more rigorous, methodical treatment of radar
   monitoring data when faced with critical slope instability will reduce
   uncertainty and increase confidence in any trigger action response
   decisions, helping to ensure a safer work environment.},

Title = {A Case Study Integrating Numerical Simulation and InSAR Monitoring to
   Analyze Bedding-Controlled Landslide in Nanfen Open-Pit Mine},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bedding-controlled landslides are a common geological hazard for
   open-pit metal mines and occur on layered rock slopes. It can spread
   spatially over the final boundary of the dip slope and persist
   throughout the entire life cycle of the mine, substantially compromising
   the safety of mining operations. Identifying potential landslide areas
   and determining the landslide mechanism is crucial for the safety
   production and slope management of mines. This study proposes a
   combination of satellite radar interferometry measurement and numerical
   simulation to determine the landslide mechanism of the
   bedding-controlled slope in open-pit mines. First, the multidimensional
   small baseline subset (MSBAS) technique of interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) is used to capture deformation information in the
   vertical and east-west directions of the slope, locate large-scale and
   long-term movements, and preliminarily determine the trend of
   landslides. Then, a layered slope damage constitutive model is
   established, and a three-dimensional stability calculation of the
   layered slope is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software based
   on the strength reduction method to study the development and evolution
   process of landslides. The effectiveness of the method is validated by a
   large-scale bedding-controlled slope failure in the Nanfen open-pit mine
   in Liaoning, China, revealing the failure mechanism of the slope under
   excavation conditions. The study shows that the eastern slope
   bedding-controlled landslide in the Nanfen open-pit mine is a multizone
   composite-mode landslide caused by excavation, which belongs to the
   shear-slip-tension deformation failure mechanism as a whole. This study
   provides a new method for analyzing the mechanism of layered rock slope
   landslides under mining activities in open-pit mines, which can be used
   to assess and predict similar landslides.},

Title = {Combining Satellite InSAR, Slope Units and Finite Element Modeling for
   Stability Analysis in Mining Waste Disposal Areas},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Slope failures pose a substantial threat to mining activity due to their
   destructive potential and high probability of occurrence on steep slopes
   close to limit equilibrium conditions, which are often found both in
   open pits and in waste and tailing disposal facilities. The development
   of slope monitoring and modeling programs usually entails the
   exploitation of in situ and remote sensing data, together with the
   application of numerical modeling, and it plays an important role in the
   definition of prevention and mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the
   impact of slope failures in mining areas. In this paper, a new
   methodology is presented; one that combines satellite radar
   interferometry and 2D finite element modeling for slope stability
   analysis at a regional scale, and applied within slope unit polygons.
   Although the literature includes many studies applying radar
   interferometry and modeling for slope stability analysis, the addition
   of slope units as input data for radar interferometry and modeling
   purposes has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. A former
   mining area in southeast Spain was studied, and the method proved useful
   for detecting and characterizing a large number of unstable slopes. Out
   of the 1959 slope units used for the spatial analysis of the radar
   interferometry data, 43 were unstable, with varying values of safety
   factor and landslide size. Out of the 43 active slope units, 21
   exhibited line of sight velocities greater than the maximum error
   obtained through validation analysis (2.5 cm/year). Finally, this work
   discusses the possibility of using the results of the proposed approach
   to devise a proxy for landslide hazard. The proposed methodology can
   help to provide non-expert final users with intelligible, clear, and
   easily comparable information to analyze slope instabilities in
   different settings, and not limited to mining areas.},

Abstract = {Numerous open-pit mines are scattered within the southern mountainous
   areas of China. Due to the complex mountainous terrain and abundant
   rainfall, surface disturbances caused by open-pit mining activities pose
   a serious risk of landslides. To identify potential landslide hazards in
   mountainous open-pit mining areas in advance, this study proposes a
   quantitative method that utilizes ascending and descending orbit
   Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to
   accurately identify landslide hazards. We select the Xiaolongtan coal
   mining area in Yunnan, China, as a case study. Small Baseline Subset
   InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology was employed to obtain the Line of Sight
   (LOS) deformation of ascending and descending orbits from November 2019
   to November 2021. Following this, two-dimensional deformations were
   calculated based on the obtained LOS deformations. Multiple remote
   sensing data sources, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
   Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and
   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were utilized to extract
   potential landslide points based on vertical deformation. A combined
   subjective and objective weighting method was then used to assess the
   landslide hazard in the study area, and an information quantity model
   was constructed for landslide hazards in the mining area. Finally, based
   on high-resolution remote sensing images from the study period,
   potential landslide hazards were identified in the study area. The
   results reveal that the vertical deformation rate in the mining area
   ranges from - 231.73 to 81.42 mm/year, indicating significant subsidence
   and uplift tendencies. A total of 2353 potential landslide points were
   identified, primarily located near the slopes of two open-pit mines and
   in areas with low vegetation coverage. The Xiaolongtan and Buzhaoba
   open-pit mines, along with the surrounding regions in the study area,
   were identified to exhibit relatively high landslide hazards. Among the
   three coal mine waste dumps, the Beipingba waste dump presents a higher
   landslide hazard. This study provides a scientific basis and practical
   reference for identifying landslide hazards in mountainous open-pit
   mining areas.},

Abstract = {Radar slope monitoring is now widely used across the world, for example,
   the slope stability radar (SSR) and the movement and surveying radar
   (MSR) are currently in use in many mines around the world. However, to
   fully realize the effectiveness of this radar in notifying mine
   personnel of an impending slope failure, a method that can confidently
   predict the time of failure is necessary. The model developed in this
   study is based on the inverse velocity method pioneered by Fukuzono in
   1985. The model named the slope failure prediction model (SFPM) was
   validated with the displacement data from two slope failures monitored
   with the MSR. The model was found to be very effective in predicting the
   time to failure while providing adequate evacuation time once the
   progressive displacement stage is reached. (C) 2014 Published by

   provided data for the slope instability prediction. The stability
   calculation is performed and analyzed for the failed site of the pit
   wall. It is shown at the adopted strength properties, failure of the
   upper bench is only possible as its stability factor is less than 1.50.
   The causes of instability could be the decreased strength of the pit
   wall as a result of weathering or watering, and failure could occur
   along a fracture. An industrial building in the close vicinity of the
   failure site had no influence on the slope stability. The
   recommendations on finding certain causes of instability are given.},

Title = {A case study integrating numerical simulation and GB-InSAR monitoring to
   analyze flexural toppling of an anti-dip slope in Fushun open pit},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {20-32},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Toppling failure of rock slopes is a complicated mode due to a
   combination of both continuous and discontinuous deformation, especially
   in dealing with anti-dip rock slopes. In this paper, a novel
   continuum-based discrete element method (CDEM), which is useful in
   modeling the entire progressive process from continuous to discontinuous
   deformation, is proposed to analyze the deformation characteristics, the
   failure mechanism and the evolution process of a large-scale open pit
   slope with a typical anti-dip structure. To simulate the slope
   deformation, the shear strength reduction method (SSR) is adopted to
   represent the strength degradation of rock mass in the deterioration
   process. The simulated results are validated using data obtained from a
   field investigation and continuous monitoring by employing an advanced
   remote sensing technique called ground-based interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (GB-InSAR). To analyze the evolution trend of the
   anti-dip slope, the subsequent toppling failure mode is predicted using
   the validated CDEM models. Based on a case study of a slope at the
   Fushun open pit mine (in Fushun, China), the unique geological structure
   with various joints and discontinuities, ground-water, intense rainfall,
   and mining activities are identified as the main triggers for different
   failure stages. The comparison between the field data and the simulation
   shows that CDEM accurately depicts the rock deformation and the failure
   pattern of the studied slope. The proposed numerical modeling techniques
   can be used for predicting failures of other similar excavated rock
   slopes. The simulated evolution process and the recorded deformation
   patterns help engineers to gain a better understanding of rock mass
   movement of anti-dip slopes, and the presented methodology could be
   utilized for similar studies and engineering designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this paper, the slope of the open pit of Dahongshan iron ore mine in

   settlement values of the slope under natural and rainfall conditions are
   derived by the finite element software Midas/GTS, and the surface
   settlement versus time is produced by fusing the InSAR monitoring
   results of the study area for a whole year to judge the stability of the
   open pit slope. The results show that the settlement and deformation
   areas shown by numerical simulation and InSAR monitoring results are
   consistent; the comparison between InSAR monitoring results and rainfall
   intensity shows that the cumulative value of slope settlement has a high
   correlation with heavy rainfall. The safety coefficients of the slopes
   of the open pit under natural conditions and rainfall conditions are
   1.50 and 1.21, the cumulative value of settlement in InSAR monitoring
   data for one year is 18.4 mm, and no obvious large deformation area is
   found. The use of numerical simulation combined with InSAR monitoring
   can realize the analysis of the stability of the slope of the open pit

Abstract = {Purpose There are a large number of open-pit coal mines in the world,
   and their dependent, heterogeneous dump sites are one of the world's
   largest chronic waste concerns. The long-term existence of dumps is
   vulnerable to non-uniform deformation and erosion simultaneously,
   seriously threatening also the surrounding geological and ecological
   security. Hence, it is critical to monitor the potential geologic
   hazards erosion activity of such a large, unstable accumulation.
   Materials and methods In this study, topographic observations were
   performed using the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode
   of the up-to-date high-quality synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images
   from the Sentinel-1B (S-1B) satellite, while unmanned aerial vehicle
   (UAV) photogrammetric data were used to assist in phase unwrapping,
   showing the deformation and soil erosion of the Baorixile open-pit coal
   mine dump in China from September 2016 to September 2019. At the same
   time, the possible areas of geological disasters were predicted, and the
   formation mechanism of different types of erosion was analyzed. Results
   and discussion The validation indicates that the deformation monitoring
   results by S-1B data matched well with the measured value. The soil
   consolidation has a positive effect on improving dump geological
   stability, while soil erosion has the opposite effect. The high
   correlation between accumulation consolidation and stacking height was
   used to distinguish soil consolidation and soil erosion from total
   deformation. The dump has undergone subsidence and/or erosion under
   gravity and non-gravity factors. The overall cumulative vertical
   subsidence and slope deformation ranged from 12 to - 298 mm (negative
   values indicate that the target moved away from the sensor) and from 4
   to 365 mm, respectively. The deformation was aggravated with the
   increase of the stacking height of the dump site, especially at the edge
   of the top area. Soil erosion and slope instability were the results of
   the combined action of multiple factors, such as spring snowmelt
   erosion, summer (rainy season) surface runoff erosion and internal
   seepage erosion, autumn wind erosion, and winter frost heaving erosion.
   Potential slope destabilization hazards and hidden danger areas of slope
   instability need continuous attention. Conclusion In summary, the
   deformation analysis suggests that the collaborative application of S-1B
   SAR image and UAV photogrammetric data demonstrates the practicability
   of the fine deformation monitoring service in the dump site and can be a
   useful tool for long-term continuous deformation and soil erosion
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {Mining activity causes environmental pollution and geological hazards
   such as ground subsidence or landslide of which continuous monitoring is
   necessary. In this study, the activity on the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine
   (FWOPM), one of the largest open pit coal mines in Asia located in
   Fushun, Liaoning Province, China, was analyzed by using a time series
   Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence dataset. By using the difference between the
   two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the area, it was possible to
   confirm that there was a stockpiling activity in the western area of the
   FWOPM while excavation activity in the eastern area. By using RGB
   composite images using the yearly-averaged InSAR coherence images, the
   activity of the mine was confirmed by period, which was confirmed by
   Google Earth optical images. As a result, it was possible to confirm
   three landslides and the related activities on the northwest slope and
   the dumping activity on the west slope of FWOPM.},

Title = {Integration of ground-based radar and satellite InSAR data for the
   analysis of an unexpected slope failure in an open-pit mine},

Abstract = {On 17 November 2016, an unexpected slope failure occurred in an
   undisclosed copper open-pit mine. The nature of the event urged for a
   thorough back-analysis of slope monitoring data in order to assess its
   size and temporal evolution, and to determine whether precursors
   potentially able to anticipate the failure were present. To this aim,
   satellite InSAR data spanning over the final 9 months before the event
   were, in retrospect, acquired and coupled with measurements from a
   ground-based radar that was in use at the time of the failure. Although
   progressive deformation was detected by the ground-based radar in
   correspondence of the two uppermost benches in the pit, the satellite
   InSAR data revealed that the vast majority of the instability actually
   involved a large part of natural slope above the mine crest. This sector
   was not visible by the ground-based radar. Thanks to the short revisit
   time of the Sentinel-1 mission, clear slope accelerating creep was
   observed for the first time in satellite InSAR measurements over an
   open-pit mine. The delimitation of the area featuring accelerating creep
   behavior matched remarkably the source area of the failure as mapped in
   the field after the event. Considerations on the volume of the
   instability and on the development of the failure process (both in space
   and time) were consequently derived. The results provided a clear
   example of the value of jointly using ground-based and satellite
   interferometry to reduce the uncertainties inherent to the
   identification and characterization of impending catastrophic slope
   failures.},

Title = {Subsidence Monitoring Base on SBAS-InSAR and Slope Stability Analysis
   Method for Damage Analysis in Mountainous Mining Subsidence Regions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Surface subsidence caused by coal mining has a great impact on the
   geological and ecological environments and causes damage to houses,
   roads, and industrial buildings. In order to understand the subsidence
   pattern in the mountainous mining regions, three mining faces of the
   Zhangjiamao mining area in the north of Shaanxi province, northwestern
   China are taken as case study. Firstly, the small baseline subset (SBAS)
   technology is used to process 12 images obtained in the mining area to
   investigate the subsidence data from December 2019 to April 2020. The
   boundary of surface deformation of the mining area interpreted by the
   SBAS-InSAR technology is inconsistent with the theoretical boundary
   suggested by coal mine subsidence theories. Especially, there are some
   areas in which the real subsidence are larger than estimated area. This
   discrepancy must be corrected as steep slopes near the theoretical
   boundary may increase the likelihood of landslides. Our research
   indicates that: (1) The accumulated displacement and the maximum
   deformation rate reached -120.759 mm and -270.012 mm/yr in the study
   area, and the subsidence boundary of the three mining faces is revealed;
   (2) the combination of the predicted boundary and slope stability
   analysis can effectively identify the landslide region at the edge of
   subsidence boundary; (3) the field surveys have proved the effectiveness
   of this method. The mining area subsidence revealed by our research
   helps to further understand the impact of land subsidence caused by
   mining in the mountainous areas and provides a practical method to
   predict subsidence boundaries and the likelihood for landslides.},

Title = {Effect of digital elevation models on monitoring slope displacements in
   open-pit mine by differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar},

Abstract = {Displacement monitoring in open-pit mines is one of the important tasks
   for safe management of mining processes. Differential interferometric
   synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), mounted on an artificial satellite,
   has the potential to be a cost-effective method for monitoring surface
   displacements over extensive areas, such as open-pit mines. DInSAR
   requires the ground surface elevation data in the process of its
   analysis as a digital elevation model (DEM). However, since the
   topography of the ground surface in open-pit mines changes largely due
   to excavations, measurement errors can occur due to insufficient
   information on the elevation of mining areas. In this paper, effect of
   different elevation models on the accuracy of the displacement
   monitoring results by DInSAR is investigated at a limestone quarry. In
   addition, validity of the DInSAR results using an appropriate DEM is
   examined by comparing them with the results obtained by global
   positioning system (GPS) monitoring conducted for three years at the
   same limestone quarry. It is found that the uncertainty of DEMs induces
   large errors in the displacement monitoring results if the baseline
   length of the satellites between the master and the slave data is longer
   than a few hundred meters. Comparing the monitoring results of DInSAR
   and GPS, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the discrepancy between
   the two sets of results is less than 10 mm if an appropriate DEM,
   considering the excavation processes, is used. It is proven that DInSAR
   can be applied for monitoring the displacements of mine slopes with
   centimeter-level accuracy. (C) 2020 Institute of Rock and Soil

Title = {Terrain Point Cloud Assisted GB-InSAR Slope and Pavement Deformation
   Differentiate Method in an Open-Pit Mine},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},

Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ground-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (GB-InSAR) is a
   valuable tool for deformation monitoring. The 2D interferograms obtained
   by GB-InSAR can be integrated with a 3D terrain model to visually and
   accurately locate deformed areas. The process has been preliminarily
   realized by geometric mapping assisted by terrestrial laser scanning
   (TLS). However, due to the line-of-sight (LOS) deformation monitoring,
   shadow and layover often occur in topographically rugged areas, which
   makes it difficult to distinguish the deformed points on the slope
   between the ones on the pavement. The extant resampling and
   interpolation method, which is designed for solving the scale difference
   between the point cloud and radar pixels, does not consider the local
   scattering characteristics difference of slope. The scattering
   difference information of road surface and slope surface in the terrain
   model is deeply weakened. We propose a differentiated method with
   integrated GB-InSAR and terrain surface point cloud. Local geometric and
   scattering characteristics of the slope were extracted, which account
   for pavement and slope differentiating. The geometric model is based on
   a GB-InSAR system with linear repeated-pass and the topographic point
   cloud relative observation geometry. The scattering model is based on
   k-nearest neighbor (KNN) points in small patches varies as radar
   micro-wave incident angle changes. Simulation and a field experiment
   were conducted in an open-pit mine. The results show that the proposed
   method effectively distinguishes pavement and slope surface deformation
   and the abnormal area boundary is partially relieved.},

Abstract = {In this study, time-series of Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence images were used to monitor the mining
   activity of Musan open-pit mine, the largest iron mine in North Korea.
   First, the subtraction of SRTM DEM (2000) from TanDEM-X DEM (2010-2015)
   has identified two major accumulation areas, one in the east (+112.33 m)
   and the other in the west (+84.03 m), and a major excavation area
   (-42.54 m) at the center of the mine. A total of 89 high-quality
   coherence images with a 12-day baseline from 2015 to 2020 were converted
   to the normalized difference activity index (NDAI), a newly developed
   activity indicator robust to spatial and temporal decorrelation. An RGB
   composite of annually averaged NDAI maps (red for 2019, green for 2018,
   and blue for 2017) showed that overall activity has diminished since
   2018. Dumping slopes were categorized into shrinking, expanding, or
   transitional, according to the color pattern. Migration and expansion of
   excavation sites were also found on the pit floor. Time series of 12-day
   NDAI graphs revealed the date of activities with monthly accuracy. It is
   believed that NDAI with continuous acquisition of Sentinel-1A/B data can
   provide detailed monitoring of various types of activities in open-pit
   mines especially with limited in situ data.},

Abstract = {A good knowledge of the mechanism of slope failure in open-cast mines
   can be understood by evaluating the intrinsic and extrinsic factors and
   their interactions in causing slope instability, and by gathering
   displacement information from periodical monitoring. Surface
   deformations, caused by mining activities at mine sites, are
   conventionally measured by using survey instruments such as levels,
   theodolites, total stations, GPS receivers, and photogrammetric cameras.
   However, conventional long-term monitoring techniques are insufficient
   due to unfavorable factors such as topographic structure and flora of
   the observation, urbanization rate, and time delays in obtaining
   results. Due to this fact that the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (InSAR) technique has become prominent in recent years as a method
   that uses satellite data to enable the detection of surface deformations
   and movements especially in very large areas. In this study, the
   mechanism of slope failure accurately detected by way of associating
   mechanical and physical information of the slopes with time-dependent
   deformation behavior (time series analysis) by periodically monitoring
   of displacements at the benches of a lignite open pit that experienced
   interruptions of production due to slope failures. Mining area has been
   periodically monitored by InSAR and data consisting of the
   time-dependent behavior of the deformations were correlated with the
   mechanical and physical property data that were obtained from back
   analysis of slope failure using finite elements method (FEM)
   approximation. In this context, a dynamic method was proposed that can
   predict the failure risk of the slopes at the site before the critical
   displacement values are not reached.},

Title = {Sensitivity Evaluation of Time Series InSAR Monitoring Results for
   Landslide Detection},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques
   are important for landslide detection and monitoring; however, several
   limitations and uncertainties, such as the unique north-south flying
   direction and side-look radar observing geometry, currently limit the
   ability of InSAR to credibly detect landslides, especially those related
   to high and steep slopes. Here, we conducted experimental and
   statistical analysis on the feasibility of time-series InSAR monitoring
   for steep slopes using ascending and descending SAR images. First, the
   theoretical (T-GNSS), practical (P-GNSS), and terrain (H-terrain)
   (T-P-H) indices for sensitivity evaluations of the slope displacement
   monitoring results from time-series InSAR were proposed for slope
   monitoring. Subsequently, two experimental and statistical studies were
   conducted for the cases with and without Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) monitoring data. Our experimental results of two high and
   steep open-pit mines showed that the defined theoretical and practical
   sensitivity indices can quantitatively evaluate the feasibility of
   ascending and descending InSAR observations in steep-slope deformation
   monitoring with GNSS data, and the terrain sensitivity index can
   qualitatively evaluate the feasibility of landslide monitoring results
   from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite data without GNSS
   data. We further demonstrate the generalizability of these proposed
   indices using four landslide cases with both public GNSS and InSAR
   monitoring data and 119 landslide cases with only InSAR monitoring data.
   The statistical results indicated that greater indices correlated with
   higher reliability of the monitoring results, suggesting that these
   novel indices have wide suitability and applicability. This study can
   help to improve the practice of slope deformation monitoring using
   spaceborne InSAR, especially for high and steep slopes.},

Title = {Development and application of a pseudo-3D pit slope displacement map

Abstract = {Slope monitoring plays an important role in the risk management of large
   open pit slopes. Historically, displacement data derived from measuring
   geodetic prisms have been relied upon to delineate the boundaries of
   potential slope hazards; however that data can be limited by its
   point-measurement nature. Localized displacements at each prism may be
   misinterpreted when extended to the behavior of the entire slope, and
   important displacements between prisms may be overlooked. New
   technologies like ground-based radar can provide high resolution, full
   area coverage of a slope in combination with near real-time acquisition
   and millimeter precision. As a line-of-sight instrument, these tools
   provide data on displacement magnitudes and rates, but not true
   direction hence limiting their use in gaining understanding of the
   kinematics and behavior of the moving slope. This paper describes a
   novel experiment in which two ground-based synthetic aperture radar
   systems were simultaneously deployed to record continuous, line-of-sight
   displacements of an open pit slope in ``stereo{''}. The displacement
   vectors were combined to create a pseudo 3-D displacement map for the
   slope, which was subsequently used to interpret the influence of a major
   fault and the rock mass fabric in promoting different kinematic
   responses. The data collected demonstrates that an improved
   understanding of the 3-D kinematics of a large rock slope can be
   achieved using advanced state-of-the-art monitoring techniques to aid
   mine design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Excavation and material stockpiling activities in the mining process
   cause a change in the distribution of forces and stresses in the
   material. As a result, the material will seek a new equilibrium by
   releasing the load through a landslide. As part of mitigation, it is
   necessary to monitor displacements occurring on slopes using
   high-accuracy devices. Ground-based radar is a technique considered to
   have good ability to detect displacements in real-time. However,
   ground-based radar has a weakness in that it cannot detect vertical
   displacement. One of the emerging technologies that is used for
   monitoring vertical displacements as LoS displacements is D-InSAR
   analysis. With the integration of both methods, displacements that occur
   horizontally and vertically on a slope can be detected properly. In
   addition, the decrease in rock mass strength due to displacement can be
   predicted based on numerical analysis using the finite element method.
   Monitoring was carried out from December 10th, 2021 to April 9th, 2022.
   The monitoring results from the beginning to the end of the period
   showed that the horizontal and vertical displacements that occurred in
   the low wall area were 1247.34 mm and 292.5 mm, respectively. Correlated
   with these conditions, the Young's modulus value of the rock mass
   decreased between 3\% and 35\%.},

Abstract = {Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is a
   space-geodetic technique which allows minute surface displacements over
   vast areas to be detected with centimetric accuracy. Because of these
   unique characteristics, the DInSAR approach has great advantages over
   classical geodetic monitoring systems that allow the anticipation of
   high-risk situations. In the past few decades, it has been successfully
   applied in many areas of the earth and environmental sciences. However,
   there have been very few applications of this approach to active open
   pit mines in tropical environments. In this work, the DInSAR technique
   was applied to detect and monitor unknown surface displacements that may
   be occurring in the N4W iron mine, northern Brazil. X-band data acquired
   from March 2012 to April 2013 during the TerraSAR-X satellite mission
   were utilized for this purpose. The results were checked in the field
   and compared to optical leveling data. Due to the consistent deformation
   pattern observed over a mine waste pile, Pile W, we also performed
   numerical modeling in order to carry out a preliminary assessment of its
   theoretical deformation behavior. The results show that most of the
   study area can be considered to be stable. The numerical modeling
   indicated that horizontal displacements may be occurring, and that the
   DInSAR technique can be used to provide an initial rapid assessment of a
   large-scale deformation field, which could prove to be very useful,
   particularly in large active mining areas.},

Abstract = {Mine slope landslides seriously threaten the safety of people's lives
   and property in mining areas. Landslide prediction is an effective way
   to reduce losses due to such disasters. In recent years,
   micro-deformation monitoring radar has been widely used in mine slope
   landslide monitoring. However, traditional landslide prediction methods
   are not able to make full use of the diversified monitoring data from
   these radars. This paper proposes a landslide time prediction method
   based on the time series monitoring data of micro-deformation monitoring
   radar. Specifically, deformation displacement, coherence and deformation
   volume, and the parametric degree of deformation (DOD) are calculated
   and combined with the use of the tangent angle method. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the method is verified by using measured data of a
   landslide in a mining area. The experimental results show that our
   proposed method can be used to identify the characteristics of an
   imminent sliding slope and landslide in advance, providing monitoring
   personnel with more reliable landslide prediction results.},

Abstract = {The first application of ground-based interferometric synthetic-aperture
   radar (GBInSAR) for slope monitoring dates back 13 years. Today, GBInSAR
   is used internationally as a leading-edge tool for near-real-time

   The success of the technology relies mainly on its ability to measure
   slope movements rapidly with sub-millimetric accuracy over wide areas
   and in almost any weather conditions. In recent years, GBInSAR has
   experienced significant improvements, due to the development of more
   advanced radar techniques in terms of both data processing and sensor
   performance. These improvements have led to widespread diffusion of the
   technology for early warning monitoring of slopes in both civil and
   mining applications. The main technical features of modern SAR
   technology for slope monitoring are discussed in this paper. A
   comparative analysis with other monitoring technologies is also
   presented along with some recent examples of successful slope

Title = {Activity of Okgye Limestone Mine in South Korea Observed by InSAR
   Coherence and PSInSAR Techniques},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Okgye limestone mine, which is the largest open-pit limestone mine
   located in a mountainous area in Korea, suffered a collapse in 2012 that
   claimed four casualties. Restoration work on the rocky mined-out slopes,
   as well as mining and dumping activities, are still in progress.
   Monitoring slope stability is important to prevent the sudden collapse
   of slopes, which can be efficiently performed by satellite-based
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. Firstly, we
   obtained elevation changes using InSAR-generated Copernicus 30 m DEM in
   2014 and an SRTM 1Sec DEM in 2000, through which the area was roughly
   classified into the mining area, tailings storage area, and the
   mined-out area. A time series of 12-day coherence images produced by
   Sentinel-1B SAR were averaged annually to produce an RGB-composite image
   to observe the change in mining activities during 2018, 2019, and 2020.
   We found many persistent scatterers (PS) when observing the ground
   displacement, both in the ascending and descending orbits, from which we
   decomposed this into the vertical and east components. The largest
   displacement of 63.6 mm/year was observed during 2019 and 2020 in the
   tailings storage area in the direction of the dumping slope. For the
   rocky outcrops and the transmission tower, we found a seasonal
   oscillation, which can be interpreted as the thermal expansion of

Abstract = {Landslides are highly destructive geological disasters, often preceded
   by changes in surface displacement. This study explores the
   effectiveness of real aperture radar (RAR) in landslide monitoring and
   early warning. Using the three-stage creep theory, the short-term simple
   moving average velocity (SMA) and long-term simple moving average
   velocity (LMA) were used to determine the end point of the constant
   displacement stage, while the hypothesis test method was used to confirm
   its starting point. Based on these points, the average velocity was
   calculated. A five-level warning model and criteria were established by
   integrating acceleration, velocity change, and tangent angle. Three
   landslide cases in Northeast China were analyzed to evaluate the dynamic
   application of this model. The results indicate that: (1) RAR
   effectively identifies abnormal displacement region; (2) Successful
   warnings in the three cases validate the effectiveness of the warning
   model and criteria; (3) The five-level warning model and criteria of RAR
   demonstrate strong application potential in the dynamic monitoring and
   early warning of landslide disasters.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal slope stability analytics for failure estimation

   failure},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Impending catastrophic failure of granular earth slopes manifests
   distinct kinematic patterns in space and time. While risk assessments of
   slope failure hazards have routinely relied on the monitoring of ground
   motion, such precursory failure patterns remain poorly understood. A key
   challenge is the multiplicity of spatiotemporal scales and dynamical
   regimes. In particular, there exist a precursory failure regime where
   two mesoscale mechanisms coevolve, namely, the preferred transmission
   paths for force and damage. Despite extensive studies, a formulation
   which can address their coevolution not just in laboratory tests but
   also in large, uncontrolled field environments has proved elusive. Here
   we address this problem by developing a slope stability analytics
   framework which uses network flow theory and mesoscience to model this
   coevolution and predict emergent kinematic clusters solely from surface
   ground motion data. We test this framework on four data sets: one at the
   laboratory scale using individual grain displacement data; three at the
   field scale using line-of-sight displacement of a slope surface, from
   ground-based radar in two mines and from space-borne radar for the 2017
   Xinmo landslide. The dynamics of the kinematic clusters deliver an early
   prediction of the geometry, location and time of failure.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has been widely used in
   landslide deformation monitoring in the past decade. It has the
   advantages of high monitoring accuracy, a wide range, and flexibility
   allowing all-weather continuous monitoring. The self-developed S-SAR
   synthetic aperture radar (slope radar) is the first completely
   domestic-made radar used in slope deformation monitoring equipment in
   China, and its performance and technical parameters are equal to or
   better than similar products made abroad. The characteristics of
   deformation data collected by S-SAR slope radar deployed in the front
   open pit mine are analyzed to further develop a spatio-temporal
   landslide prediction method which is applicable to the massive
   monitoring data within the monitoring range of slope radar. The
   intersection points of short-term moving average velocity curve and
   long-term moving average velocity curve of slope deformation, which are
   onset of acceleration (OOA) and termination of acceleration (TOA). When
   OOA occurs, the deformation will accelerate, and when TOA occurs, the
   deformation will tend to stabilize. The OOA can identify areas at risk
   in the monitored area before failure, so that the spatial position
   prediction of landslide early warning can be realized. Based on the
   assumptions of the inverse velocity method, a T-log (t) logarithmic
   model is established, and the updated monitoring data are corrected to
   approximate the time of failure, thus improving the accuracy of
   landslide location and time prediction. In an open-pit copper mine in
   Serbia, the accurate prediction of landslide location and time has been
   successfully applied, guaranteeing safe mining.},

Title = {Updating Active Deformation Inventory Maps in Mining Areas by
   Integrating InSAR and LiDAR Datasets},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Slope failures, subsidence, earthworks, consolidation of waste dumps,
   and erosion are typical active deformation processes that pose a
   significant hazard in current and abandoned mining areas, given their
   considerable potential to produce damage and affect the population at
   large. This work proves the potential of exploiting space-borne InSAR
   and airborne LiDAR techniques, combined with data inferred through a
   simple slope stability geotechnical model, to obtain and update
   inventory maps of active deformations in mining areas. The proposed
   approach is illustrated by analyzing the region of Sierra de
   Cartagena-La Union (Murcia), a mountainous mining area in southeast
   Spain. Firstly, we processed Sentinel-1 InSAR imagery acquired both in
   ascending and descending orbits covering the period from October 2016 to
   November 2021. The obtained ascending and descending deformation
   velocities were then separately post-processed to semi-automatically
   generate two active deformation areas (ADA) maps by using ADATool.
   Subsequently, the PS-InSAR LOS displacements of the ascending and
   descending tracks were decomposed into vertical and east-west
   components. Complementarily, open-access, and non-customized LiDAR point
   clouds were used to analyze surface changes and movements. Furthermore,
   a slope stability safety factor (SF) map was obtained over the study
   area adopting a simple infinite slope stability model. Finally, the
   InSAR-derived maps, the LiDAR-derived map, and the SF map were
   integrated to update a previously published landslides' inventory map
   and to perform a preliminary classification of the different active
   deformation areas with the support of optical images and a geological
   map. Complementarily, a level of activity index is defined to state the
   reliability of the detected ADA. A total of 28, 19, 5, and 12 ADAs were
   identified through ascending, descending, horizontal, and vertical InSAR
   datasets, respectively, and 58 ADAs from the LiDAR change detection map.
   The subsequent preliminary classification of the ADA enabled the
   identification of eight areas of consolidation of waste dumps, 11 zones
   in which earthworks were performed, three areas affected by erosion
   processes, 17 landslides, two mining subsidence zone, seven areas
   affected by compound processes, and 23 possible false positive ADAs. The
   results highlight the effectiveness of these two remote sensing
   techniques (i.e., InSAR and LiDAR) in conjunction with simple
   geotechnical models and with the support of orthophotos and geological
   information to update inventory maps of active deformation areas in
   mining zones.},

Abstract = {Dump sites with broken overburden layers in surface mines have the risk
   of instability due to their loose bulk structures. In this study,
   deformations at a dump site of the Kangal/Kalburc,ayiri open-pit coal
   mine and their long-term behaviours were revealed with InSAR data for a
   total period of 4.5 years. Firstly, 9-periods involving different time
   ranges were created considering the presence of LiCSAR products. Then,
   the deformation velocities of each period were calculated by LiCSBAS
   software using LiCSAR products. The area where high deformations were
   concentrated from the LiCSBAS result products was determined and divided
   into 4 zones for more detailed evaluations. At the final stage, the
   period-deformation velocity graphs were drawn separately for each zone
   with the data obtained using two different approaches from the
   deformation velocities of all periods, and long-term deformation
   behaviours were determined. More reliable future behaviour projections
   could be made considering the current increasing or decreasing trend of
   deformation behaviours. It was revealed that vertical deformations at
   the dump site had an increasing trend in the first periods and a
   decreasing trend in the later periods. Maximum vertical deformation
   velocities ranging between -111.4 mm/year and -178.0 mm/year in the
   first 4 months reached the highest values (ranging from -141.9 mm/year
   to -261.8 mm/year) at the end of two years and decreased to values
   ranging from -33.0 mm/ year to -44.3 mm/year in the later periods. It
   was found that horizontal deformation velocities ranged between +0.5
   mm/year and +55.4 mm/year in the east-west direction and between -7.0
   mm/year and -56.8 mm/year in the west-east direction, were approximately
   5 times lower than vertical velocities and did not have a constantly
   increasing or decreasing trend in any direction. It was observed that
   deformations exhibited a behaviour resulting from the structural
   property of the dump bulk material. The results of the evaluations
   showed that the risk of instability gradually decreased at the dump
   site. The methodology of this study can enable the determination of
   similar areas that may pose a threat in a short time, the prioritization
   of risky areas, the planning of more detailed (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published

Title = {Research on the Application of Dynamic Process Correlation Based on
   Radar Data in Mine Slope Sliding Early Warning},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {With the gradual expansion of mining scale in open-pit coal mines, slope
   safety problems are increasingly diversified and complicated. In order
   to reduce the potential loss caused by slope sliding and reduce the
   major threat to the safety of life and property of residents in the
   mining area, this study selected two mining areas in Xinjiang as cases
   and focused on the relationship between phase noise and deformation. The
   study predicts the specific time point of slope sliding by analyzing the
   dynamic history correlation tangent angle between the two. Firstly, the
   time series data of the micro-variation monitoring radar are used to
   obtain the small deformation of the study area by differential InSAR
   (D-InSAR), and the phase noise is extracted from the radar echo in the
   sequence data. Then, the volume of the deformation body is calculated by
   analyzing the small deformation at each time point, and the standard
   deviation of the phase noise is calculated accordingly. Finally, the
   sliding time of the deformation body is predicted by combining the
   tangent angle of the ratio of the volume of the deformation body to the
   standard deviation of the phase noise. The results show that the maximum
   deformation rates of the deformation bodies in the studied mining areas
   reach 10.1 mm/h and 6.65 mm/h, respectively, and the maximum deformation
   volumes are 2,619,521.74 mm3 and 2,503,794.206 mm3, respectively. The
   predicted landslide time is earlier than the actual landslide time,
   which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. This prediction
   method can effectively identify the upcoming sliding events and the
   characteristics of the slope, provide more accurate and reliable
   prediction results for the slope monitoring staff, and significantly
   improve the efficiency of slope monitoring and early warning.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (MT-InSAR) technology is adopted to monitor the Line of Sight
   (LOS) displacement of Fushun West Opencast Coal Mine (FWOCM) and its
   surrounding areas in northeast China using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (SAR) images acquired from 2018 to 2022. The spatial-temporal
   evolution of urban subsidence and the south-slope landslide are both
   analyzed in detail. Comparison with ground measurements and
   cross-correlation analysis via cross wavelet transform with monthly
   precipitation data are also conducted, to analyze the influence factors
   of displacements in FWOCM. The monitoring results show that a subsidence
   basin appeared in the urban area near the eastern part of the north
   slope in 2018, with settlement center located at the intersection of
   E3000 and fault F1. The Qian Tai Shan (QTS) landslide on the south
   slope, which experienced rapid sliding during 2014 to 2016, presents
   seasonal deceleration and acceleration with precipitation, with the
   maximum displacement in vicinity of the Liushan paleochannel. The
   results of this paper have fully taken in account for the complications
   of large topographic relief, geological conditions, spatial distribution
   and temporal evolution characteristics of surface displacements in
   opencast mining area. The wide range and long time series dynamic
   monitoring of opencast mine are of great significance to ensure mine
   safety production and geological disaster prevention in the investigated
   mining area.},

Abstract = {European Remote Sensing satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) data are used to analyze terrain deformation in the area of
   Wieliczka, Poland using interferometric techniques. Terrain deformations
   in Wieliczka are due to (i) salt mining, (ii) catastrophic suffusion
   caused by water inflows to the mine and (iii) landslides in the southern
   part of the region. To discriminate between different deformation
   regimes differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) and persistent
   scatterers interferometry (PSI) are used. A comparison with published
   information based on leveling data is performed. It can be concluded
   that rapid subsidence caused by catastrophic water inflow cannot be
   identified with InSAR techniques. However, both D-InSAR and PSI retrieve
   information about slow subsidence due to mine convergence. These data
   match with subsidence maps constructed from leveling data. A limited
   amount of coherent scatterers were identified on landslides. Some
   scatterers; can be related to buildings with clear damage caused by
   landslide movement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Soil instability is a major hazard facing the mining industry in its
   role of supplying the indispensable mineral resources that our societal
   challenges require. Aiming to demonstrate the monitoring potential of
   radar satellites in the mining sector, we analyze the deformation field
   in the Riotinto mine, Spain. We propose a new method for combining
   ascending and descending results into a common dataset that provides
   better resolution. We project the LOS measurements resulting from both
   geometries to a common reference system without applying any type of
   geometric restriction. As a projection system, we use the vertical
   direction in flat areas and the slope in steep topographies. We then
   identify and remove outliers and artifacts from the joint dataset to
   finally obtain a deformation map that combines the two acquisition
   perspectives. The results in the Atalaya pit are consistent with GNSS
   measurements. The movements observed in the rock dumps were unknown
   before this study. We demonstrate the great potential of the Sentinel-1
   satellite as a complementary tool for monitoring systems in mining
   environments and we call for its use to be standardized to guarantee a
   safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources necessary for a just
   technological transition.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of satellite Interferometric Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (InSAR) to identify precursors to catastrophic slope
   failures. To date, early-warning has mostly relied on the availability
   of detailed, high-frequency data from sensors installed in situ. The
   same purpose could not be chased through spaceborne monitoring
   applications, as these could not yield information acquired in
   sufficiently systematic fashion. Here we present three sets of
   Sentinel-1 constellation images processed by means of
   multi-interferometric analysis. We detect clear trends of accelerating
   displacement prior to the catastrophic failure of three large slopes of
   very different nature: an open-pit mine slope, a natural rock slope in
   alpine terrain, and a tailings dam embankment. We determine that these
   events could have been located several days or weeks in advance. The
   results highlight that satellite InSAR may now be used to support
   decision making and enhance predictive ability for this type of hazard.},

Title = {Study on surface deformation pattern in mine closure area of complex
   karst mountainous region based on SBAS-InSAR technology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Liupanshui City in Guizhou Province represents a karst mountainous
   region with a delicate geological environment. The area has a long
   history of coal mining, and several coal mines have been progressively
   closed in recent years. However, even after closure of coal mines, the
   fractured rock mass in the mined-out areas continues to undergo
   deformation over a specific period. In karst mountainous regions, this
   deformation is affected by various factors including elevation, slope,
   precipitation, and vegetation. In this study, we employed SBAS-InSAR
   technology to construct a time series of surface deformation data from
   January 2019 to May 2022 within Liupanshui City's LuJiaZhai-DaPingDi
   Minefield. Subsequently, this data was comprehensively analyzed in
   conjunction with time series vegetation cover, monthly precipitation,
   elevation, and slope data from the identical period. The key findings of
   this research are as follows: 1) After the closure of the mine, the
   subsidence area gradually stabilized, yet the volume of subsidence
   continues to increase. The subsidence area primarily occurs near the
   MaiZiGou Coal Mine air-mining area, which had a relatively short closure
   time, as well as in higher elevation areas in the southern and eastern
   parts of the minefield. Specifically, the maximum cumulative subsidence
   and the subsidence rate during the study period reached -60.3 mm and
   -21.83 mm/a, respectively. 2) Surface deformation is closely linked to
   slope, vegetation type, and rainfall, with subsidence rates and amounts
   noticeably higher during the rainy season than in the dry season. 3)
   Surface vegetation cover types display varied effects on deformation,
   with grassland or shrub areas being more sensitive to precipitation than
   forests. Forests, especially pine and fir, show a delayed subsidence
   response to rain, typically 2-3 months post-rainy season onset. This
   inhibitory effect lessens with increasing slope, particularly beyond a
   25 degrees threshold, where responsiveness to precipitation and

Abstract = {In order to prevent landslide and collapse in the mining area, it is
   essential not only to gain a full understanding of the surface
   defor-mation information about the open-pit mining area and surrounding
   dumps, but also to closely monitor the development of surface
   deformation. Small baseline set (SBAS) technology can be applied to
   extract the high-resolution spatial-temporal deformation informa-tion
   from the mining areas. Due to decoherence, however, it is difficult to
   obtain the effective information on deformation from some areas where
   the results are monitored. This paper proposes a kriging interpolation
   method that performs better in filling the missing values in the InSAR
   monitored results by integrating GPS measured data with InSAR monitored
   data. In the experimental process, 69 Sentinel-1 image data were
   collected from July 2018 to November 2020. The SBAS-InSAR technology was
   applied to monitor the surface deformation caused to the Kunyang
   phosphate mining area and surrounding dumping sites. It was found out
   that all the mining areas across the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine and the
   surrounding dumps suffered severe surface deformation, with the maximum
   line of sight (LOS) deformation rate of-132 mm/yr located in the dump in
   the north of the second mining area. The verification result shows that
   InSAR measurement results are consistent with the deformation estimated
   from GPS measurements. The root mean square error of most points is
   maintained within \& PLUSMN;10 mm. The Kriging interpolation results of
   fusion GPS data are in good agreement with the GPS results. The root
   mean square errors at the 4 verification points are \& PLUSMN;6.2 mm, \&
   PLUSMN;4.6 mm, \& PLUSMN;6.4 mm, \& PLUSMN;7.8 mm. The method proposed
   in this paper is effective in filling in the missing values in the
   incoherent area, and can be applied to mine surface deformation
   monitoring with high reliability. The results of this paper serve as a
   scientific basis for the prevention and control of landslides, collapses
   and other hidden risks of geological disasters posed by the mining
   operations conducted in the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

Title = {Instability Monitoring and Numerical Analysis of Typical Coal Mines in
   Southwest China Based on DS-InSAR},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Most of the coal mines in Southwest China are located in mountainous
   areas with high vegetation coverage, and most activities are carried out
   under the mountains. The deformation monitoring and mechanical behavior
   analysis of the mining area helps reveal the typical mountain
   deformation and failure mechanism caused by underground mining
   activities and reduce the risk of mountain collapse in the mining area.
   In this manuscript, a research method for mountain stability in mining
   areas is proposed, which combines InSAR deformation monitoring with
   numerical analysis. Based on the high-precision deformation information
   obtained by DS-InSAR and the landslide range, a three-dimensional
   explicit finite difference numerical analysis method was used to
   reconstruct the landslide model. According to the layout of the coal
   mining working face, the variation mechanism of overlying stratum stress
   and the mountain slip in the coal mining process is inverted, and the
   mechanism of mountain failure and instability in the mining area is
   analysed. Based on the sentinel data, the experiment performed time
   series monitoring and inversion analysis of the mountain collapse in
   Nayong, Guizhou, China. The results show that mining activities a
   certain distance from the mountain will affect mountain stability, and
   there are specific mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the stress
   redistribution of overlying strata above the goaf area resulted in dense
   longitudinal cracks in the landslide body due to coal mining. The
   mountain is in a continuous damage state, and the supporting force to
   prevent collapse continues to decrease, resulting in a gradual decrease
   in landslide stability. Both the time series DS-InSAR monitoring results
   and numerical simulation results verify the actual occurrence and
   development of the on-site subsidence.},

Abstract = {Mining-induced surface deformation disrupts ecological balance and
   impedes economic progress. This study employs SBAS-InSAR with 107-view
   of ascending and descending SAR data from Sentinel-1, spanning February
   2017 to September 2020, to monitor surface deformation in the Fa'er Coal
   Mine, Guizhou Province. Analysis on the surface deformation time series
   reveals the relationship between underground mining and surface shifts.
   Considering geological conditions, mining activities, duration, and
   ranges, the study determines surface movement parameters for the coal
   mine. It asserts that mining depth significantly influences surface
   movement parameters in mountainous mining areas. Increasing mining depth
   elevates the strike movement angle on the deeper side of the burial
   depth by 22.84 degrees, while decreasing by 7.74 degrees on the
   shallower side. Uphill movement angles decrease by 4.06 degrees, while
   downhill movement angles increase by 15.71 degrees. This emphasizes the
   technology's suitability for local mining design, which lays the
   groundwork for resource development, disaster prevention, and ecological
   protection in analogous contexts.},

Abstract = {The detection of joints and discontinuities is of particular importance
   to the stability of a broad range of geostructures, including slopes and
   underground and open-pit mines. As a common example, the mechanical

   stress distribution that governs the stability factor of safety as well
   as the failure mechanism. In this article, surface geophysics scanning
   by ground penetrating radar (GPR) is presented for the detection of
   vertical joints at one of the largest open-pit coal mines in Australia.
   The optimum soil velocity, point interval, and antenna frequency for
   joint detection in Victorian Brown Coal (VBC) are presented in
   comparison with electromagnetic properties of known organic soils.
   Furthermore, the performance of an assorted set of post-processing

Abstract = {Drone-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis offers a simple and
   efficient technique for acquiring observational data from various
   research areas. However, fundamental research on observation techniques,
   including the investigation of drone flight parameters, remains
   insufficient. This study focuses on improving the resolution of
   intensity images of a single-look complex (SLC) via drone-based SAR
   observations. By conducting experiments at different flight speeds and
   analysing the obtained SLC images, we demonstrated that higher drone
   speeds resulted in enhanced image resolution under the conditions
   investigated at flight speeds of <= 5 m s(-1). A comparison with
   satellite SAR images highlighted the superior performance of drone-based
   SAR in capturing topographic features. The analysis also suggested that
   factors including trajectory deviation and Doppler rate affected the
   resolution and azimuth position. The simulation results supported the
   experimental findings on the relationship between drone speed and
   resolution. Our results emphasize the potential of drone-based SAR
   observations for monitoring slope failures and suggest the importance of
   the drone flight parameter selection. In the future, drone-based SAR is
   expected to produce intensity images of slopes and locate slope
   deformations associated with blasting for mining and earthquakes.},

Abstract = {Block caving often leads to significant ground deformations that if not
   properly assessed and accounted for may threaten the integrity and
   safety of overlying mine infrastructure. To mitigate this risk,
   sophisticated 3-D numerical modelling has been turned to as a means of
   predicting the extent and magnitudes of caving-induced surface
   subsidence. However, the complexity of the rock mass interactions
   involved, coupled with the uncertainty associated with geological
   heterogeneity, rock mass properties and in-situ stresses results in the
   need for models to be constrained and calibrated. Results are first
   presented here from a detailed 3-D back analysis of a caving-induced
   open pit mine slope failure, used to constrain the rock mass properties
   and far-field in-situ stresses derived from field characterisation data,
   as well as to bring understanding to the problem with respect to the
   cave-pit interactions. The ``best fit{''} set of input properties
   obtained was then used for forward modelling of caving-induced
   subsidence for the period 2009-2010. Further calibration of this model
   was performed using high-resolution InSAR monitoring data. The close fit
   achieved between the predictive 3-D numerical model and InSAR data
   demonstrates the promise of InSAR as a means to calibrate sophisticated
   numerical models, and thereby contribute to managing block caving
   associated subsidence hazards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Landslides, often a side effect of mining activities, pose a significant
   risk to humans and infrastructures such as urban areas, power lines, and
   dams. Operational ground motion monitoring can help detect the spatial
   pattern of surface changes and their evolution over time. In this
   technical note, a commercial, cost-effective method combining a network
   of geotechnical surface sensors with the InSAR data was reported for the
   first time to accurately monitor surface displacement. The correlation
   of both data sets is demonstrated in the Gediminas Castle testbed, where
   slope failure events were detected. Two specific events were analyzed,
   and possible causes proposed. The combination of techniques allows one
   to detect the precursors of the events and characterize the consequences
   of the failures in different areas in proximity to the castle walls,
   since the solution allows for the confirmation of long-term drifts and
   sudden movements in real time. The data from the in situ sensors were
   also used to refine the satellite data analysis. The results demonstrate
   that not all events pose a direct threat to the safety of the structure
   monitored.},

Title = {INVESTIGATION OF THE MINING DEPARTMENTS INFLUENCE OF SOLOTVYNSKY SALT
   MINE SE ON THE EARTH SURFACE, BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTIONS USING SATELITE
   RADAR MONITORING},
Journal = {GEODYNAMICS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {31},
Pages = {41-52},
Abstract = {The most dangerous exogenous geological processes (EGP) in terms of the
   amount of damage caused to economic objects include: landslides, karst,
   flooding, abrasion, mudslides, etc. The distribution and intensity of
   EGP are determined by the peculiarities of geological and
   geomorphological structure of the territory, its tectonic, neotectonic
   and seismic regime, as well as hydrological, climatic, hydrogeological
   paleo- and modern conditions. Solotvynsky salt mine is one of the oldest
   enterprises in Transcarpathia. The field has been exploited since the
   Roman Empire. In 1360, a settlement of salt miners, Solotvyno, was
   founded on the site of the mine, which later became a center of salt
   production and a royal monopoly. There are a total of nine mines in the
   field. In 1995-1996 and 2001, floods began flooding mines. In 2005,
   landslides and karst abysses intensified in Solotvyno, leading to damage
   to residential buildings, roads and infrastructure. There was a complete
   flooding of the mines of two mines. Currently, dangerous natural and
   man-made processes are observed on the territory of the salt mine and
   adjacent territories. This is mainly salt karst, both underground and
   surface, the collapse of areas in the location of mines, as well as
   landslides. Therefore, the purpose of the research is to conduct a
   geodynamic audit of SOLOTVYNSKY SALT MINE SE and the surrounding area
   with the possibility of identifying areas with subsidence or rise of the
   earth's surface, which are gradually slowing down, accelerating or
   developing at a constant rate. Output data. Radar interferometry data in
   the period from April 30, 2016 to June 25, 2018 were used for research
   and performance of geodynamic audit of SOLOTVYNSKY SALT MINE SE and the
   adjacent territory. Modern methods of interferometric processing of
   satellite radar data are used in the work: the method of ``PS{''} - the
   method of constant scatterers, and the method SBAS - the method of small
   baselines. The method of geometric leveling was used to measure vertical
   displacements in some places on the earth's surface in order to verify
   interferometric data. Monitoring of the area of interest was carried out
   using modern technologies of satellite radar interferometry. According
   to the results of observations of landslides and individual objects by
   space (radar interferometry) and ground (geometric leveling) methods, a
   high correlation of data was recorded and the presence of zones of
   active subsidence in the mining area was confirmed.},

Title = {Calculating vertical deformation using a single InSAR pair based on
   singular value decomposition in mining areas},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vertical deformation estimation can be a significant tool in preventing
   geological hazards and managing environment impacts of underground
   mining. Common ground surface vertical deformation calculations are
   challenged by difficult data collection and dependence on prior
   knowledge. SVD (singular value decomposition) method was applied to
   estimate ground surface vertical deformation from single pair SAR
   (synthetic aperture radar) data in a mining region. During the study,
   LOS (line of sight) and azimuth displacement was obtained using two pass
   D-InSAR (differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar) and MAI
   (multi-aperture radar interferometry) technology, respectively. Two
   adjustment equations were composed using the imaging geometry of D-InSAR
   and MAI. The singular value decomposition theorem was used to acquire
   M-P (Moore-Penrose) generalized inverse of the rank deficiency
   coefficient matrix. From this, the optimal approximation solution of
   unknown parameters was calculated using weighted least squares. A
   working panel in the Datong mining area, Shanxi province, China, was
   selected to verify the SVD approach using the two ascending Sentinel-1A
   data. The accuracy of vertical deformation estimated by SVD approach is
   reliable. The RMSE (root mean square error) of vertical deformation is
   2.64 mm (along upright profile) and 4.95 mm (along horizontal profile).
   These results suggest that the SVD approach will complement widely used
   vertical ground surface deformation calculations. Further study is
   needed to validate the method from other deformation scenarios from
   landslides, groundwater loss, earthquakes, underground mining, and
   glacier movement.},

Abstract = {Rapid landscape changes as a result of anthropogenic development can
   result in increased hazards for nearby communities, including exposure
   of soils to runoff, pollution, and slope collapse. Elevation changes
   also complicate interpretations of remote sensing datasets, such as
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), which rely on accurate
   digital elevation models (DEMs). In this study, we assimilate
   satellite-based radar and optical imagery spanning several decades to
   determine a time series of elevation change at the Centralia Coal Mine
   in Centralia, Washington. We assess the errors associated with each
   observation type and explore methods for reducing potential bias. By
   combining these datasets, we are able to characterize elevation changes
   resulting from coal mining operations for most of the productive
   lifespan of the mine. This approach can be applied to any region of
   rapid elevation change, provided sufficient remote sensing data are
   available.},

Title = {SPARX, a MIMO Array for Ground-Based Radar Interferometry},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Ground-Based SAR Interferometry (GB-InSAR) is nowadays a proven
   technique widely used for slope monitoring in open pit mines and
   landslide control. Traditional GB-InSAR techniques involve transmitting
   and receiving antennas moving on a scanner to achieve the desired
   synthetic aperture. Mechanical movement limits the acquisition speed of
   the SAR image. There is a need for faster acquisition time as it plays
   an important role in correcting rapidly varying atmospheric effects.
   Also, a fast imaging radar can extend the applications to the
   measurement of vibrations of large structures. Furthermore, the
   mechanical assembly put constraints on the transportability and weight
   of the system. To overcome these limitations an electronically switched
   array would be preferable, which however faces enormous technological
   and cost difficulties associated to the large number of array elements
   needed. Imaging Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radars can be used
   as a significant alternative to usual mechanical SAR and full array
   systems. This paper describes the ground-based X-band MIMO radar SPARX
   recently developed by IDS GeoRadar in order to overcome the limits of
   IDS GeoRadar's well-established ground based interferometric SAR
   systems. The SPARX array consists of 16 transmit and 16 receive
   antennas, organized in independent sub-modules and geometrically
   arranged in order to synthesize an equally spaced virtual array of 256
   elements.},

   on the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain in 1903 and claimed more than 70
   lives. At the foot of the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain, the ground
   surface above the Frank Mine was found to subside at an average rate of
   about 3.1 mm per year, relative to the reference area that is located in
   the middle part of the Frank Slide, during a period from April 2004 to
   October 2006. This may support the speculation, suggested for more than
   100 years since the Frank landslide took place, that ground movements
   induced by the underground coal mines at the foot of Turtle Mountain
   might have triggered the slide. To the east of the Frank Slide debris,
   an average subsidence rate of up to 3.2 mm per year was observed for
   some areas overlying the footprint of the abandoned Bellevue underground
   mine during the same period. This is supported by reported frequent
   collapses on the ground.},

Title = {InSAR-CTPIM-Based 3D Deformation Prediction in Coal Mining Areas of the
   Baisha Reservoir, China},

Abstract = {Time series dynamic prediction of surface deformation in mining areas
   can provide reference data for coal mine safety and production, which
   has important impacts. The combination of interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) technology and the probability integral method
   (PIM) is commonly used for predicting deformation. However, most surface
   subsidence prediction in mining areas is based on the static PIM
   parameters, failing to achieve the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic
   deformation prediction. This paper proposed a 3D deformation dynamic
   prediction model (InSAR-3D-CTPIM) between InSAR deformation observations
   and dynamic coordinate-time PIM (CTPIM) parameters, which can realize
   the prediction of east-west, north-south, and vertical series
   deformation caused by mining. The method has been validated by
   simulation experiments and real experiments in the mining area of
   Jiansheng Coal Mine in Baisha Reservoir, Henan Province, China. The
   results showed that the modeling accuracy was improved by 34.3\%
   compared to the traditional multi-rate model, and the accuracy was
   improved by 28.5\% compared to the vertical deformation obtained by the
   traditional static PIM method. The InSAR-3D-CTPIM model can be used to
   predict the evolutionary history of basin-wide surface deformation
   dynamics in coal mining areas, and provide a reference for the early
   warning and prediction of geological hazards in coal mining areas.},

Title = {Assessment of the Available Historic RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar
   Data Prior to the Manefay Slide at the Bingham Canyon Mine Using Modern
   InSAR Techniques},

Abstract = {In April 2013, Rio Tinto Kennecott Copper's (RTKC) Bingham Canyon Mine
   experienced what is arguably the world's largest ever in-pit slope
   failure. The failure initiated on the east wall of the mine, along
   major, continuous, low-strength bedding faults, which were the upper and
   lower contact of the Manefay hornfels bed. The failure comprised
   approximately 145 million tonnes of rock and waste dump material. East
   wall slope deformations were detected some months prior to the
   catastrophic slope collapse by RTKC's ground-based slope monitoring
   systems. Use of existing terrestrial radar and prism monitoring systems
   provided excellent data to manage the response to the slope collapse.
   The failure resulted in no injuries/loss of life, although the failure
   runout distance was longer than expected, resulting in the loss of
   mining equipment and significant production interruption. Post-failure
   investigations identified an RTKC-sponsored, university research
   project, which detected a zone of sporadic ground deformation at the
   crest of the Manefay failure using satellite-based Interferometric
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring. When the outcomes of this
   research study were received in 2010, RTKC responded by conducting
   detailed field inspections, installing prisms in the area of concern and
   monitoring the area closely in the years before the event.
   Interferometric methods for calculating ground displacement from
   satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have improved
   significantly since the time leading up to the Manefay failure. These
   updated methods have been used in this study of the available historic
   SAR data with results indicating that significant ground movements were
   occurring over a number of years prior to failure. Detailed knowledge of
   these movements could potentially have led to a different interpretation
   of failure mechanisms and magnitude and, in hindsight, different slope
   management and mine development plans in the years preceding slope
   failure. From a business and mine operations perspective, the ability to
   identify subtle signs of slope failure before a catastrophic slope
   collapse is essential for appropriate management of such events. The use
   of InSAR monitoring, as discussed in this paper, provides an increased
   capability for further improved slope management at RTKC, and at other
   mining operations.},

Title = {Deformation Monitoring in an Alpine Mining Area in the Tianshan
   Mountains Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The fragile habitat of alpine mining areas can be greatly affected by
   surface disturbances caused by mining activities, particularly open-pit
   mining activities, which greatly affect the periglacial environment.
   SBAS-InSAR technology enables the processing of SAR images to obtain
   highly accurate surface deformation information. This paper applied
   SBAS-InSAR technology to obtain three years of surface subsidence
   information based on the 89-scene Sentinel-1A SLC products, covering a
   mining area (tailings and active areas) in the Tianshan Mountains and
   its surroundings from 25(th) December 2017 to 2(nd) January 2021. The
   data were adopted to analyze the characteristics of deformation in the
   study region and the mining areas, and the subsidence accumulation was
   compared with field GNSS observation results to verify its accuracy. The
   results showed that the study area settled significantly, with a maximum
   settlement rate of -44.80 mm/a and a maximum uplift rate of 28.04 mm/a.
   The maximum settlement and accumulation of the whole study area over the
   three-year period were -129.39 mm and 60.49 mm, respectively. The mining
   area had a settlement value of over 80 mm over the three years.
   Significantly, the settlement rates of the tailings and active areas
   were -35 mm/a and -40 mm/a, respectively. Debris accumulation in the
   eastern portion of the tailings and active areas near the mountain was
   serious, with accumulation rates of 25 mm/a and 20 mm/a, respectively,
   and both had accumulation amounts of around 70 mm. For mine tailing pile
   areas with river flows, the pile locations and environmental restoration
   should be appropriately adjusted at a later stage. For gravel pile
   areas, regular cleaning should be carried out, especially around the
   mining site and at the tunnel entrances and exits, and long-term
   deformation monitoring of these areas should be carried out to ensure
   safe operation of the mining site. The SBAS-InSAR measurements were able
   to yield deformations with high accuracies over a wide area and cost
   less human and financial resources than the GNSS measurement method.
   Furthermore, the measurement results were more macroscopic, with great
   application value for surface subsidence monitoring in alpine areas.},

Title = {InSAR time series and LSTM model to support early warning detection
   tools of ground instabilities: mining site case studies},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},

Abstract = {Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and
   the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities.
   Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate
   valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions.
   Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to
   set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study
   proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground
   instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is
   capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long
   short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements
   in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5
   multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent
   time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe
   regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground
   motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to
   activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in
   vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in
   Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are
   analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact
   of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems
   are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by
   experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the
   proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case
   studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR
   temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent
   measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and
   the characteristics of the study area.},

Abstract = {Displacement maps from multitemporal InSAR (MTI) are usually noisy and
   fragmented. Thresholding on ensemble coherence is a common practice for
   identifying radar scatterers that are less affected by decorrelation
   noise. Thresholding on coherence might, however, cause loss of
   information over the areas undergoing more complex deformation
   scenarios. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share
   similar behavior, it appears important to take into account their
   spatial correlation for correct inference. The information over
   low-coherent areas might then be used in a similar way the coherence is
   used in thematic mapping applications such as change detection. We
   propose an approach based on data mining and statistical procedures for
   mitigating the impact of outliers in MTI results. Our approach allows
   for minimization of outliers in final results while preserving spatial
   and statistical dependence among observations. Tests from monitoring
   slope failures and undermined areas performed in this work have shown
   that this is beneficial: 1) for better evaluation of low coherent
   scatterers that are commonly discarded by the standard thresholding
   procedure, 2) for tackling outlying observations with extremes in any
   variable, 3) for improving spatial densities of standard persistent
   scatterers, 4) for the evaluation of areas undergoing more complex
   deformation scenarios, and 5) for the visualization purposes.},

   have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of
   thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In
   such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually
   aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the
   interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR
   analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the
   derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the
   deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and
   then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches
   with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies
   of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas,
   detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the
   applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving
   landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the
   computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale
   tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first
   strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing
   chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized
   deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR.},

Title = {Coal Mining Deformation Monitoring Using SBAS-InSAR and Offset Tracking:
   A Case Study of Yu County, China},

Abstract = {Ground deformation caused by underground coal mining has a large
   subsidence gradient and high nonlinearity and may cause continuous
   destruction to the surface structure after mining. A synthetic aperture
   radar interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful method for measuring and
   reconstructing the ground displacement. In this article, a total of 19
   descending orbit X-band TerraSAR-X and 16 ascending orbit C-band
   Sentinel-1 images were integrated to monitor the ground displacement of
   a coal mining area in Yu County (Hebei Province, China) using a small
   baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR) algorithm. We found that the SBAS-InSAR
   technology can obtain reliable results in regions without a high
   gradient deformation by combining the deformation rates derived from
   both the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum subsidence rate
   was approximately 125 mm/y between 17 June 2015 and 07 January 2016. In
   the case of large-gradient deformation, it is indeed difficult to obtain
   the mining-induced surface subsidence information accurately using the
   conventional multitemporal (MT-InSAR) techniques owing to the
   limitations of the SAR wavelength. In response to this problem, a new
   decision-making fusion method based on SBAS-InSAR and offset tracking
   was developed to monitor the large-gradient settlement in mining areas.
   The results show that the method developed compensates for the
   shortcomings of the traditional MT-InSAR technologies in the field of
   large-gradient deformation and obtains reliable results.},

Abstract = {Accurate measurement of the surface three-dimensional deformation fields
   in a mined-out area is essential for understanding the law of mining
   subsidence and guiding the safe production and construction of mining
   areas. In this study, we proposed an improved fusion method to monitor
   this three-dimensional deformation. We used the Helmert variance
   component estimation (HVCE) method and the back-propagation neural
   network (BPNN) to fuse the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. Based on
   this improved fusion method, we measured the three-dimensional
   deformation in the West Second Mining Area of Jinchuan, Jinchang City,
   Gansu Province, China, from March 22, 2019, to June 8, 2020. The root
   mean square errors (RMSEs) based on our method for the three directions
   of east-west (E-W), north-south (N-S), and up-down (U-D) were 21.4 mm,
   7.6 mm, and 34.2 mm, respectively. These RMSE values are lower than
   those obtained from previous methods. The results show that the spatial
   distribution of the three-dimensional deformation follows the law of
   mining subsidence.},

Title = {Mining Subsidence Prediction by Combining Support Vector Machine
   Regression and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mining subsidence is time-dependent and highly nonlinear, especially in
   the Loess Plateau region in Northwestern China. As a consequence, and
   mainly in building agglomerations, the structures can be damaged
   severely during or after underground extraction, with risks to human
   life. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a combination of a
   differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technique
   and a support vector machine (SVM) regression algorithm optimized by
   grid search (GS-SVR) to predict mining subsidence in a timely and
   cost-efficient manner. We consider five Advanced Land Observing
   Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
   (PALSAR) images encompassing the Dafosi coal mine area in Binxian and
   Changwu counties, Shaanxi Province. The results show that the subsidence
   predicted by the proposed InSAR and GS-SVR approach is consistent with
   the Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. The maximum absolute
   errors are less than 3.1 cm and the maximum relative errors are less
   than 14\%. The proposed approach combining DInSAR with GS-SVR technology
   can predict mining subsidence on the Loess Plateau of China with a high
   level of accuracy. This research may also help to provide disaster
   warnings.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The accurate prediction of surface subsidence induced by coal mining is
   critical to safeguarding the environment and resources. However, the
   precision of current prediction models is often restricted by the lack
   of pertinent data or imprecise model parameters. To overcome these
   limitations, this study proposes an approach to predicting mine
   subsidence that leverages Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
   (InSAR) technology and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The
   proposed approach utilizes small baseline multiple-master high-coherent
   target (SBMHCT) interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology to
   monitor the mine surface and applies the long short-term memory (LSTM)
   algorithm to construct the prediction model. The Shigouyi coalfield in
   Ningxia Province, China was chosen as a study area, and time series
   ground subsidence data were obtained based on Sentinel-1A data from 9
   March 2015 to 7 June 2016. To evaluate the proposed approach, the
   prediction accuracies of LSTM and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were
   compared. The results show that the proposed approach could accurately
   predict mine subsidence, with maximum absolute errors of less than 2 cm
   and maximum relative errors of less than 6\%. The findings demonstrate
   that combining InSAR technology with the LSTM algorithm is an effective
   and robust approach for predicting mine subsidence.},

Abstract = {Luanchuan mining area, which is located in Henan Province, China and
   characterized by undulating topography and large precipitation, is
   vulnerable to the landslide disasters. The observations from the
   space-borne radar (ascending and descending TerraSAR-X) images and the
   ground-based radar (GPRI-II) images are integrated to monitor the
   surface deformations in Luanchuan mining area. Before the integration of
   the observations from multi-source SAR images, the coordinate systems of
   multi-source images are required to be unified by geographical
   projection. However, the accuracy of the commonly used geographical
   coding will be degraded by external DEM errors and inaccurate satellite
   orbit, which makes it difficult to achieve the high-precision
   registration of space-borne and ground-based radar scenes. Therefore, in
   this paper the iterative closest point (ICP) method is introduced to
   register the space-borne and ground-based images, yielding sub-pixel
   registration accuracy. Reasonable weights are then assigned to
   multi-source observations through Strain Model and Variance Component
   Estimation (SM-VCE) method, from which the high-precision
   three-dimensional deformations can be reconstructed. The results show
   that the maximum deformation rates in the east-west, north-south and
   vertical directions of Luanchuan mining area from July 20, 2019, to
   August 1, 2019, are about 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 mm/day, respectively. The
   deformations are mainly on the loose slags in the Luanchuan pit rather
   than the bedrock, as a result of the accumulation of waste slags. Some
   suggestions on the installation location of ground-based radar are also
   provided to better combine the space-borne and ground-based
   observations.},

   system is presented. It is currently able to provide continuous and
   autonomous updates of MT-InSAR results and post-processing methodology
   over sites with active deformation hazards to ease the interpretation
   and facilitate decision-supporting tools for on-time situational
   awareness. Our post-processing approach implemented in remotIO's web
   application has proven to be useful in filtering the resultant
   deformation maps and in pinpointing problematic zones with potential
   ground deformation threats also over low-coherent areas.},

   technique for reconstructing three components of the displacement vector
   developed at the Institute of Physics of the Earth, Russian Academy of
   Sciences; landslide activity above a section of the North Caucasus
   Railway tunnel near the village Mamaika (Bolshoi Sochi) is investigated,
   application of persistent scatterer techniques for estimating
   displacement fields in the territory of Moscow is tested, and coseismic
   and postseismic displacements in the area of the Altai Earthquake of
   September 27, 2003, are analyzed. The latest technologies make it
   possible to ensure that the obtained results correspond to the latest

Title = {Spaceborne Radars for Mapping Surface and Subsurface Salt Pan
   Configuration: A Case Study of the Pozuelos Salt Flat in Northern
   Argentina},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Lithium mining has become a controversial issue in the transition to
   green technologies due to the intervention in natural basins that impact
   the native flora and fauna in these environments. Large resources of
   this element are concentrated in Andean salt flats in South America,
   where extraction is much easier than in other geological configurations.
   The Pozuelos highland salt flat, located in northern Argentina (Salta's
   Province), was chosen for this study due to the presence of different
   evaporitic crusts and its proven economic potential in lithium-rich
   brines. A comprehensive analysis of a 5.5-year-long time series of its
   microwave backscatter with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images yielded
   significant insights into the dynamics of their crusts. During a field
   campaign conducted near the acquisition of three SAR images (Sentinel-1,
   ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and SAOCOM-1), field measurements were collected for
   computational modeling of the SAR response. The temporal backscattering
   coefficients for the crusts in the salt flat are directly linked to
   rainfall events, where changes in surface roughness, soil moisture, and
   water table depth represent the most critical variables. Field
   parameters were employed to model the backscattering response of the
   salt flat using the Small Slope Approximation (SSA) model. Salt
   concentration of the subsurface brine and the water table depth over the
   slightly to moderately roughed crusts were quantitatively derived from
   Bayesian inference of the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and SAOCOM-1 SAR
   backscattering coefficient data. The results demonstrated the potential
   for subsurface estimation with L-band dual-polarization images,
   constrained to crusts compatible with the feasibility range of the
   layered model.},

Title = {Rectifying Discrepancies Between GB-SAR Images and Terrain Model Caused
   by Measurement Deviations in Open-Pit Mines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 30},
Abstract = {Ground-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-InSAR) is a
   valuable technique for monitoring deformation of landslides. GB-InSAR
   can construct high-resolution 2D images in a range-doppler plane.
   However, it is difficult for geo-engineers who are unfamiliar with radar
   monitoring geometry to interpret the results. Geometric mapping method
   has been applied to the co-registration of terrain models and radar
   images for the deformation zonation, but the mismatching correction with
   GB-InSAR and terrain model is not fully investigated by existing
   researches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method
   exploiting an optimum linear transformation based on ground control
   points (GCPs). The proposed method was evaluated on simulated data and a
   field campaign in an open pit mine. The deformation mapping result of
   the method was verified by a collapse event. The method proposed in this
   paper has an RMSE value ranging from 0.502 to 0.720m (@700m average
   monitoring range) when the average density of the terrain point cloud is
   0.5m. Although this method cannot accurately evaluate the antenna
   footprint vector deflection parameters, it can meet the needs of coarse
   matching calibration in relatively flat slope sub-target areas of
   open-pit mines for engineering applications.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry techniques (MT-InSAR) are nowadays a well-developed remote sensing tool for ground stability monitoring of areas afflicted by natural hazards. Its application capability has recently been emphasized by the Sentinel-1 satellite mission, providing extensive spatial coverage, regular temporal sampling and free data availability. We perform MT-InSAR analysis over the wider Upper Nitra region in Slovakia, utilizing all Sentinel-1 images acquired since November 2014 until March 2017. This region is notable for its extensive landslide susceptibility as well as intensive brown coal mining. We focus on two case studies, being impaired by recent activation of these geohazards, which caused serious damage to local structures. We incorporate a processing chain based on open-source tools, combining the current Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) implementation. MT-InSAR results reveal substantial activity at both case studies, exceeding the annual displacement velocities of 30 mm/year. Moreover, our observations are validated and their accuracy is confirmed via comparison with ground truth data from borehole inclinometers and terrestrial levelling. Detected displacement time series provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of corresponding deformation phenomena and are thus complementary to conventional terrestrial monitoring techniques. At the same time, they not only demonstrate the feasibility of MT-InSAR for the assessment of remediation works, but also constitute the possibility of operational monitoring and routine landslide inventory updates, regarding the free Sentinel-1 data. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {Slope failures occur in open-pit mining areas worldwide, producing considerable damage in addition to economic loss. Identifying the triggering factors and detecting unstable slopes and precursory displacements —which can be achieved by exploiting remote sensing data— are critical for reducing their impact. Here we present a methodology that combines digital photogrammetry, satellite radar interferometry, and geo-mechanical modeling, to perform remote analyses of slope instabilities in open-pit mining areas. We illustrate this approach through the back analysis of a massive landslide that occurred in an active open-pit mine in southwest Spain in January 2019. Based on pre- and post-event high-resolution digital elevation models derived from digital photogrammetry, we estimate an entire sliding mass volume of around 14 million m3. Radar interferometry reveals that during the year preceding the landslide, the line of sight accumulated displacement in the slope reached − 5.7 and 4.6 cm in ascending and descending geometry, respectively, showing two acceleration events clearly correlated with rainfall in descending geometry. By means of 3D and 2D stability analyses we located the slope instability, and remote sensing monitoring led us to identify the likely triggers of failure. Las Cruces event can be attributed to delayed and progressive failure mechanisms triggered by two factors: (i) the loss of historical suction due to a pore-water pressure increase driven by rainfall and (ii) the strain-softening behavior of the sliding material. Finally, we discuss the potential of this methodological approach either to remotely perform post-event analyses of mining-related landslides and evaluate potential triggering factors or to remotely identify critical slopes in mining areas and provide pre-alert warning. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Early alarm systems can activate vital precautions for saving lives and the economy threatened by natural hazards and human activities. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) products generate valuable ground motion data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Integrating the InSAR products and forecasting models make possible to set up early alarm systems to monitor vulnerable areas. This study proposes a technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using machine learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is tailored to predict ground movements in three forecast ranges (i.e., SAR observations): 3, 4, and 5 multistep. A contribution of the proposed strategy is utilizing adjacent time series to decrease the possibility of falsely detecting safe regions as significant movements. The proposed tool offers ground motion-based outcomes that can be interpreted and utilized by experts to activate early alarms to reduce the consequences of possible failures in vulnerable infrastructures, such as mining areas. Three case studies in Spain, Brazil, and Australia, where fatal incidents happened, are analyzed by the proposed early alert detector to illustrate the impact of chosen temporal and spatial ranges. Since most early alarm systems are site dependent, we propose a general tool to be interpreted by experts for activating reliable alarms. The results show that the proposed tool can identify potential regions before collapse in all case studies. In addition, the tool can suggest an optimum selection of InSAR temporal (i.e., number of images) and spatial (i.e., adjacent measurement points) combinations based on the available SAR images and the characteristics of the study area. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Liupanshui City in Guizhou Province represents a karst mountainous region with a delicate geological environment. The area has a long history of coal mining, and several coal mines have been progressively closed in recent years. However, even after closure of coal mines, the fractured rock mass in the mined-out areas continues to undergo deformation over a specific period. In karst mountainous regions, this deformation is affected by various factors including elevation, slope, precipitation, and vegetation. In this study, we employed SBAS-InSAR technology to construct a time series of surface deformation data from January 2019 to May 2022 within Liupanshui City’s LuJiaZhai-DaPingDi Minefield. Subsequently, this data was comprehensively analyzed in conjunction with time series vegetation cover, monthly precipitation, elevation, and slope data from the identical period. The key findings of this research are as follows: 1) After the closure of the mine, the subsidence area gradually stabilized, yet the volume of subsidence continues to increase. The subsidence area primarily occurs near the MaiZiGou Coal Mine air-mining area, which had a relatively short closure time, as well as in higher elevation areas in the southern and eastern parts of the minefield. Specifically, the maximum cumulative subsidence and the subsidence rate during the study period reached −60.3 mm and −21.83 mm/a, respectively. 2) Surface deformation is closely linked to slope, vegetation type, and rainfall, with subsidence rates and amounts noticeably higher during the rainy season than in the dry season. 3) Surface vegetation cover types display varied effects on deformation, with grassland or shrub areas being more sensitive to precipitation than forests. Forests, especially pine and fir, show a delayed subsidence response to rain, typically 2–3 months post-rainy season onset. This inhibitory effect lessens with increasing slope, particularly beyond a 25° threshold, where responsiveness to precipitation and associated subsidence significantly increase. The findings of this study hold substantial scientific implications for the restoration and management of closed mining areas, as well as the prevention of geological hazards in karst complex mountainous regions.

	abstract = {Ground deformation caused by underground coal mining has a large subsidence gradient and high nonlinearity and may cause continuous destruction to the surface structure after mining. A synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful method for measuring and reconstructing the ground displacement. In this article, a total of 19 descending orbit X-band TerraSAR-X and 16 ascending orbit C-band Sentinel-1 images were integrated to monitor the ground displacement of a coal mining area in Yu County (Hebei Province, China) using a small baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR) algorithm. We found that the SBAS-InSAR technology can obtain reliable results in regions without a high gradient deformation by combining the deformation rates derived from both the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum subsidence rate was approximately 125 mm/y between 17 June 2015 and 07 January 2016. In the case of large-gradient deformation, it is indeed difficult to obtain the mining-induced surface subsidence information accurately using the conventional multitemporal (MT-InSAR) techniques owing to the limitations of the SAR wavelength. In response to this problem, a new decision-making fusion method based on SBAS-InSAR and offset tracking was developed to monitor the large-gradient settlement in mining areas. The results show that the method developed compensates for the shortcomings of the traditional MT-InSAR technologies in the field of large-gradient deformation and obtains reliable results.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

Operational ground motion monitoring can help detect the spatial pattern of surface changes and their evolution over time. In this technical note, a commercial, cost-effective method combining a network of geotechnical surface sensors with the InSAR data was reported for the first time to accurately monitor surface displacement. The correlation of both data sets is demonstrated in the Gediminas Castle testbed, where slope failure events were detected. Two specific events were analyzed, and possible causes proposed. The combination of techniques allows one to detect the precursors of the events and characterize the consequences of the failures in different areas in proximity to the castle walls, since the solution allows for the confirmation of long-term drifts and sudden movements in real time. The data from the in situ sensors were also used to refine the satellite data analysis. The results demonstrate that not all events pose a direct threat to the safety of the structure monitored. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Coal mining leads to surface subsidence, landslides, soil erosion and other problems that seriously threaten the life and property safety of residents in mining areas, and it is urgent to obtain mining subsidence information using high-frequency, high-precision and large-scale monitoring methods. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the deformation monitoring of the Datong mining area using Lutan-1 monostatic and bistatic SAR data. Firstly, the latest Lutan-1 bistatic data are used to reconstruct the DSM, and the interferometric calibration method is used to improve the accuracy of the DSM. Then, the surface deformation monitoring of the mining area is implemented by using DInSAR, SBAS-InSAR and Stacking-InSAR with the reconstructed DSM data and Lutan-1 monostatic SAR data. Finally, the deformation monitoring results are compared with the surface deformation results based on the TanDEM data, and both the results are evaluated using the filed leveling data. Taking 20 images covering the Datong mining area as the data sources, the surface deformation results obtained using different InSAR methods in the mining area were quantitatively evaluated and analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) the DSM obtained using the Lutan-1 bistatic SAR data was assessed and demonstrated with the ICESat laser altimetry data an error of 2.8 m, which meets the Chinese 1:50,000 scale DEM cartographic accuracy standard, and the difference analysis with the TanDEM data shows that the terrain changes are mainly distributed in mountainous areas; (2) Due to the improvement in resolution, the registration accuracy of the SAR images and LT-DSM is higher than that of the TanDEM data in the range direction and azimuth direction; (3) Via evaluation with the filed leveling data, it is found that the surface deformation measurement results based on LT-DSM are less affected by terrain, and the accuracy of LT-DSM-SBAS and LT-DSM-DInSAR is improved by 11.5% and 16.3%, respectively, compared with TanDEM-SBAS and TanDEM-DInSAR, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the Lutan-1 bistatic and monostatic data for mine deformation monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A destructive landslide occurred in Himmetoğlu village in Göynük District (Bolu, NW Turkey) caused by open-pit coal mining activities. Field observations after the landslide failure and interviews with villagers motivated us to question the possibility of using satellite SAR data to detect precursory signs of failure with regard to deformation velocity. In this study, first, landslide deformations were mapped by applying the digital elevation model (DEM) of Difference (DoD) method using DEMs from aerial photography and UAV data. However, the primary aim was to track deformation velocity as a sign of landslide failure with persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) methods from Sentinel-1A data. For the SBAS, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 12 and 39 mm year−1 and between − 24 and 6 mm year−1, respectively. For the PSI, the deformation velocity for ascending and descending orbits varied between − 16 and 31 mm year−1 and between − 18 and 20 mm year−1, respectively. PSI and SBAS resulted in sharply changing line-of-sight displacement rates, which were interpreted as slope failure signs, from three months prior to the landslide. In addition, higher deformation velocities were observed in locations closer to landslide crack as expected. Based on our findings, we concluded that SAR interferometric time-series analysis have the makings of being used as a suitable approach in early discerning and avoiding potential slope failures in open-pit mining areas, when it is made carefully by observing the progress in mining activities by considering the other factors such as rainfall and earthquakes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There are a large number of open-pit coal mines in the world, and their dependent, heterogeneous dump sites are one of the world’s largest chronic waste concerns. The long-term existence of dumps is vulnerable to non-uniform deformation and erosion simultaneously, seriously threatening also the surrounding geological and ecological security. Hence, it is critical to monitor the potential geologic hazards erosion activity of such a large, unstable accumulation. Materials and methods: In this study, topographic observations were performed using the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode of the up-to-date high-quality synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1B (S-1B) satellite, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric data were used to assist in phase unwrapping, showing the deformation and soil erosion of the Baorixile open-pit coal mine dump in China from September 2016 to September 2019. At the same time, the possible areas of geological disasters were predicted, and the formation mechanism of different types of erosion was analyzed. Results and discussion: The validation indicates that the deformation monitoring results by S-1B data matched well with the measured value. The soil consolidation has a positive effect on improving dump geological stability, while soil erosion has the opposite effect. The high correlation between accumulation consolidation and stacking height was used to distinguish soil consolidation and soil erosion from total deformation. The dump has undergone subsidence and/or erosion under gravity and non-gravity factors. The overall cumulative vertical subsidence and slope deformation ranged from 12 to − 298 mm (negative values indicate that the target moved away from the sensor) and from 4 to 365 mm, respectively. The deformation was aggravated with the increase of the stacking height of the dump site, especially at the edge of the top area. Soil erosion and slope instability were the results of the combined action of multiple factors, such as spring snowmelt erosion, summer (rainy season) surface runoff erosion and internal seepage erosion, autumn wind erosion, and winter frost heaving erosion. Potential slope destabilization hazards and hidden danger areas of slope instability need continuous attention. Conclusion: In summary, the deformation analysis suggests that the collaborative application of S-1B SAR image and UAV photogrammetric data demonstrates the practicability of the fine deformation monitoring service in the dump site and can be a useful tool for long-term continuous deformation and soil erosion monitoring. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Due to the intrinsic side-looking geometry of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), time series interferometric SAR is only able to monitor displacements in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which limits the accuracy of displacement measurement in landslide monitoring. This is because the LOS displacement is only a three dimensional projection of real displacement of a certain ground object. Targeting at this problem, a precise digital elevation model (DEM) assisted slope displacement retrieval method is proposed and applied to a case study over the high and steep slope of the Dagushan open pit mine. In the case study, the precise DEM generated by laser scanning is first used to minimize topographic residuals in small baseline subsets analysis. Then, the LOS displacements are converted to slope direction with assistance of the precise DEM. By comparing with ground measurements, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated slope displacements reach approximately 12–13% for the ascending orbit, and 5.4–9.2% for the descending orbit in our study area. In order to validate the experimental results, comparison with microseism monitoring results is also conducted. Moreover, both results have found that the largest slope displacements occur on the slope part, with elevations varying from −138 m to −210 m, which corresponds to the landslide area. Moreover, there is a certain correlation with precipitation, as revealed by the displacement time series. The outcome of this article shows that rock mass structure, lithology, and precipitation are main factors affecting the stability of high and steep mining slopes. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Most of the coal mines in Southwest China are located in mountainous areas with high vegetation coverage, and most activities are carried out under the mountains. The deformation monitoring and mechanical behavior analysis of the mining area helps reveal the typical mountain deformation and failure mechanism caused by underground mining activities and reduce the risk of mountain collapse in the mining area. In this manuscript, a research method for mountain stability in mining areas is proposed, which combines InSAR deformation monitoring with numerical analysis. Based on the high-precision deformation information obtained by DS-InSAR and the landslide range, a three-dimensional explicit finite difference numerical analysis method was used to reconstruct the landslide model. According to the layout of the coal mining working face, the variation mechanism of overlying stratum stress and the mountain slip in the coal mining process is inverted, and the mechanism of mountain failure and instability in the mining area is analysed. Based on the sentinel data, the experiment performed time series monitoring and inversion analysis of the mountain collapse in Nayong, Guizhou, China. The results show that mining activities a certain distance from the mountain will affect mountain stability, and there are specific mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the stress redistribution of overlying strata above the goaf area resulted in dense longitudinal cracks in the landslide body due to coal mining. The mountain is in a continuous damage state, and the supporting force to prevent collapse continues to decrease, resulting in a gradual decrease in landslide stability. Both the time series DS-InSAR monitoring results and numerical simulation results verify the actual occurrence and development of the on-site subsidence. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Ground-Based SAR Interferometry (GB-InSAR) is nowadays a proven technique widely used for slope monitoring in open pit mines and landslide control. Traditional GB-InSAR techniques involve transmitting and receiving antennas moving on a scanner to achieve the desired synthetic aperture. Mechanical movement limits the acquisition speed of the SAR image. There is a need for faster acquisition time as it plays an important role in correcting rapidly varying atmospheric effects. Also, a fast imaging radar can extend the applications to the measurement of vibrations of large structures. Furthermore, the mechanical assembly put constraints on the transportability and weight of the system. To overcome these limitations an electronically switched array would be preferable, which however faces enormous technological and cost difficulties associated to the large number of array elements needed. Imaging Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radars can be used as a significant alternative to usual mechanical SAR and full array systems. This paper describes the ground-based X-band MIMO radar SPARX recently developed by IDS GeoRadar in order to overcome the limits of IDS GeoRadar’s well-established ground based interferometric SAR systems. The SPARX array consists of 16 transmit and 16 receive antennas, organized in independent sub-modules and geometrically arranged in order to synthesize an equally spaced virtual array of 256 elements. © 2019 by the authors.

It is currently able to provide continuous and autonomous updates of MT-InSAR results and post-processing methodology over sites with active deformation hazards to ease the interpretation and facilitate decision-supporting tools for on-time situational awareness.

	abstract = {In April 2013, Rio Tinto Kennecott Copper’s (RTKC) Bingham Canyon Mine experienced what is arguably the world’s largest ever in-pit slope failure. The failure initiated on the east wall of the mine, along major, continuous, low-strength bedding faults, which were the upper and lower contact of the Manefay hornfels bed. The failure comprised approximately 145 million tonnes of rock and waste dump material. East wall slope deformations were detected some months prior to the catastrophic slope collapse by RTKC’s ground-based slope monitoring systems. Use of existing terrestrial radar and prism monitoring systems provided excellent data to manage the response to the slope collapse. The failure resulted in no injuries/loss of life, although the failure runout distance was longer than expected, resulting in the loss of mining equipment and significant production interruption. Post-failure investigations identified an RTKC-sponsored, university research project, which detected a zone of sporadic ground deformation at the crest of the Manefay failure using satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring. When the outcomes of this research study were received in 2010, RTKC responded by conducting detailed field inspections, installing prisms in the area of concern and monitoring the area closely in the years before the event. Interferometric methods for calculating ground displacement from satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have improved significantly since the time leading up to the Manefay failure. These updated methods have been used in this study of the available historic SAR data with results indicating that significant ground movements were occurring over a number of years prior to failure. Detailed knowledge of these movements could potentially have led to a different interpretation of failure mechanisms and magnitude and, in hindsight, different slope management and mine development plans in the years preceding slope failure. From a business and mine operations perspective, the ability to identify subtle signs of slope failure before a catastrophic slope collapse is essential for appropriate management of such events. The use of InSAR monitoring, as discussed in this paper, provides an increased capability for further improved slope management at RTKC, and at other mining operations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is a space-geodetic technique which allows minute surface displacements over vast areas to be detected with centimetric accuracy. Because of these unique characteristics, the DInSAR approach has great advantages over classical geodetic monitoring systems that allow the anticipation of high-risk situations. In the past few decades, it has been successfully applied in many areas of the earth and environmental sciences. However, there have been very few applications of this approach to active open pit mines in tropical environments. In this work, the DInSAR technique was applied to detect and monitor unknown surface displacements that may be occurring in the N4W iron mine, northern Brazil. X-band data acquired from March 2012 to April 2013 during the TerraSAR-X satellite mission were utilized for this purpose. The results were checked in the field and compared to optical leveling data. Due to the consistent deformation pattern observed over a mine waste pile, Pile W, we also performed numerical modeling in order to carry out a preliminary assessment of its theoretical deformation behavior. The results show that most of the study area can be considered to be stable. The numerical modeling indicated that horizontal displacements may be occurring, and that the DInSAR technique can be used to provide an initial rapid assessment of a large-scale deformation field, which could prove to be very useful, particularly in large active mining areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this study, the activity on the Fushun West Open-Pit Mine (FWOPM), one of the largest open-pit coal mines in Asia located in Fushun, Liaoning Province, China, was analyzed by using a time-series Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence dataset. By using the difference between the two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of the area, it was possible to confirm that there was a stockpiling activity in the western area of the FWOPM while excavation activity in the eastern area. By using RGB composite images using the yearly-averaged InSAR coherence images, the activity of the mine was confirmed by period, which was confirmed by Google Earth optical images. As a result, it was possible to confirm three landslides and the related activities on the northwest slope and the dumping activity on the west slope of FWOPM.

	abstract = {The Xishan coal mine area in Beijing, China has a long history of mining. Many landslide hazards, in addition to collapses and ground fractures, have occurred in this area. This study used multi-temporal satellite images to extract this region’s deformation information, identify landslides and analyze the deformation evolution process of these landslides. Taking the Anzigou ditch as an example, we investigate the “Quarry–Landslide–Mudslide” disaster chain model. We found that the landslide evolution process is closely related to the geological conditions, and usually goes through four stages: initial deformation, slope front swelling and collapsing, rear part connecting and rupturing, and landslide creeping. The surface deformation can be identified and tracked by high-resolution optical images and InSAR monitoring. Under the combined effects of rainfall and topographic conditions, medium and large landslides may occur and trigger a “Quarry–Landslide–Mudflow” disaster chain. The identification and analysis of these landslide hazards and the disaster chain help with geological disaster prevention, and provide reference for early identification and research of similar disasters. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides an all-weather imaging capability for measuring ground-surface deformation and inferring changes in land surface characteristics. InSAR enables scientists to monitor and characterize hazards posed by volcanic, seismic, and hydrogeologic processes, by landslides and wildfires, and by human activities such as mining and fluid extraction or injection. Measuring how a volcano's surface deforms before, during, and after eruptions provides essential information about magma dynamics and a basis for mitigating volcanic hazards. Measuring spatial and temporal patterns of surface deformation in seismically active regions is extraordinarily useful for understanding rupture dynamics and estimating seismic risks. Measuring how landslides develop and activate is a prerequisite to minimizing associated hazards. Mapping surface subsidence or uplift related to extraction or injection of fluids during exploitation of groundwater aquifers or petroleum reservoirs provides fundamental data on aquifer or reservoir properties and improves our ability to mitigate undesired consequences. Monitoring dynamic water-level changes in wetlands improves hydrological modeling predictions and the assessment of future flood impacts. In addition, InSAR imagery can provide near-real-time estimates of fire scar extents and fire severity for wildfire management and control. All-weather satellite radar imagery is critical for studying various natural processes and is playing an increasingly important role in understanding and forecasting natural hazards. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The coastline environment and urban areas of Peru overlooking the Pacific Ocean are among the most affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and its cascading hazards such as floods, landslides and avalanches. In this work, the complete archives of the European Space Agency (ESA)'s European Remote-Sensing (ERS-1/2) missions and European Commission's Copernicus Sentinel-1 constellation were screened to select synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images covering the most severe and recent ENSO-related flooding events that affected Lima, the capital and largest city of Peru, in 1997-1998 and 2017-2018. Based on SAR backscatter color composites and ratio maps retrieved from a series of pre-, cross-and post-event SAR pairs, flooded areas were delineated within the Rimac River watershed. These are mostly concentrated along the riverbanks and plain, where low-lying topography and gentle slopes (≤5°), together with the presence of alluvial deposits, also indicate greater susceptibility to flooding. A total of 409 areas (58.50 km2) revealing change were mapped, including 197 changes (32.10 km2) due to flooding-related backscatter variations (flooded areas, increased water flow in the riverbed, and riverbank collapses and damage), and 212 (26.40 km2) due to other processes (e.g., new urban developments, construction of river embankments, other engineering works, vegetation changes). Urban and landscape changes potentially contributing, either detrimentally or beneficially, to flooding susceptibility were identified and considered in the overall assessment of risk. The extent of built-up areas within the basin was mapped by combining information from the 2011 Global Urban Footprint (GUF) produced by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Open Street Map (OSM) accessed from the Quantum GIS (QGIS) service, and 2011-2019 very high-resolution optical imagery from Google Earth. The resulting flooding risk map highlights the sectors of potential concern along the Rimac River, should flooding events of equal severity as those captured by SAR images occur in the future. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A good knowledge of the mechanism of slope failure in open-cast mines can be understood by evaluating the intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their interactions in causing slope instability, and by gathering displacement information from periodical monitoring. Surface deformations, caused by mining activities at mine sites, are conventionally measured by using survey instruments such as levels, theodolites, total stations, GPS receivers, and photogrammetric cameras. However, conventional long-term monitoring techniques are insufficient due to unfavorable factors such as topographic structure and flora of the observation, urbanization rate, and time delays in obtaining results. Due to this fact that the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has become prominent in recent years as a method that uses satellite data to enable the detection of surface deformations and movements especially in very large areas. In this study, the mechanism of slope failure accurately detected by way of associating mechanical and physical information of the slopes with time-dependent deformation behavior (time series analysis) by periodically monitoring of displacements at the benches of a lignite open pit that experienced interruptions of production due to slope failures. Mining area has been periodically monitored by InSAR and data consisting of the time-dependent behavior of the deformations were correlated with the mechanical and physical property data that were obtained from back analysis of slope failure using finite elements method (FEM) approximation. In this context, a dynamic method was proposed that can predict the failure risk of the slopes at the site before the critical displacement values are not reached. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

	abstract = {Instabilities are extremely common in the iron open-pit mines located in the Carajás mineral province, the world´s largest iron reserves located in the Brazilian Amazon. Due to deep excavations in rock products of low geomechanical quality, heavy precipitation, and blasting practices, mining operations in the area present surface displacements that potentially lead to slope instabilities with several risks (personnel, equipment, mining infrastructure, etc.). This paper presents the results related to the N5E mine based on DInSAR Time Series (DTS) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) using a temporal series of 33 StripMap TerraSAR-X (SM TSX) images, and geological information provided from a 3D photointerpretation of an SM TSX and Ultra-Fine RADARSAT-2 (UF RST) stereo-pair, calibrated with field data. Measurement point (DTS, PSI) results were compared with in situ geodetic survey information (total station/prism measurements) and showed good agreement indicating that most of the mine can be considered stable during the period of the TSX coverage. The highest accumulated displacements were spatially related to a thematic unit mapped as a landfill. For other sectors of the mine, lower deformation rates were related to photointerpreted lineaments related to the Carajás fault system suggesting that geological structures can play a key role in controlling some surface displacements. The investigation demonstrated that the strategy based on the use of DTS and PSI techniques integrated with geological data provided a synoptic view of the deformation process that affected the mine. The approach was relevant for ground displacements monitoring of the study area with DInSAR results compared with in situ geodetic measurements showing good statistical correlation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Based on these points, the average velocity was calculated. A five-level warning model and criteria were established by integrating acceleration, velocity change, and tangent angle. Three landslide cases in Northeast China were analyzed to evaluate the dynamic application of this model. The results indicate that: (1) RAR effectively identifies abnormal displacement region; (2) Successful warnings in the three cases validate the effectiveness of the warning model and criteria; (3) The five-level warning model and criteria of RAR demonstrate strong application potential in the dynamic monitoring and early warning of landslide disasters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Lithium mining has become a controversial issue in the transition to green technologies due to the intervention in natural basins that impact the native flora and fauna in these environments. Large resources of this element are concentrated in Andean salt flats in South America, where extraction is much easier than in other geological configurations. The Pozuelos highland salt flat, located in northern Argentina (Salta’s Province), was chosen for this study due to the presence of different evaporitic crusts and its proven economic potential in lithium-rich brines. A comprehensive analysis of a 5.5-year-long time series of its microwave backscatter with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images yielded significant insights into the dynamics of their crusts. During a field campaign conducted near the acquisition of three SAR images (Sentinel-1, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and SAOCOM-1), field measurements were collected for computational modeling of the SAR response. The temporal backscattering coefficients for the crusts in the salt flat are directly linked to rainfall events, where changes in surface roughness, soil moisture, and water table depth represent the most critical variables. Field parameters were employed to model the backscattering response of the salt flat using the Small Slope Approximation (SSA) model. Salt concentration of the subsurface brine and the water table depth over the slightly to moderately roughed crusts were quantitatively derived from Bayesian inference of the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and SAOCOM-1 SAR backscattering coefficient data. The results demonstrated the potential for subsurface estimation with L-band dual-polarization images, constrained to crusts compatible with the feasibility range of the layered model. © 2024 by the authors.},

We recorded 21 GPR profiles in three consecutive benches with the unshielded 50. MHz rough terrain antenna (RTA) system, and correlated them with the results of detailed structural and lithological mapping of the area. We located several karst cavities and confirmed the presence of discontinuities with the interpretation of GPR profiles alone. However, their correlation with geological and structural data gave a more precise insight into the structural setting of the studied area. The different discontinuity families specified in the Rodež open pit mine are mainly the result of the strike-slip tectonics and gradual anisotropic lithology. The complexity of the intersections of structural discontinuities and the mechanical properties of rocks contribute to the formation of sliding surfaces and the developing of karst features. Cavities and phreatic channels develop in the vadose zone in calcarenites and result from complex structural deformation and karstification factors at the open joints or larger structural fractures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Azul mining complex, located in the Carajas Mineral Province, Amazon region, encompasses the most important manganese mine in Brazil. Vale S.A. company operates three simultaneous open pit excavations (mines 1, 2, and 3) in the area, which are conducted on rock alteration products of low geomechanical quality related to sandstones, siltstones, and a lateritic cover. In order to monitor ground deformation, 33 TerraSAR-X (TSX-1) StripMap images covering the period of March 2012-April 2013 were used in the investigation. An advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (A-DInSAR) approach based on persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) using an interferometric point target analysis algorithm was applied, and the results showed that most of the area was considered stable during the time span of the synthetic aperture radar acquisitions. However, persistent scatterers (PS) with high deformation rates were mapped over a waste pile, probably related to settlements, and also along the north flank of mine 1, indicative of cut slope movements toward the center of the pit. A spatial relationship of geological structures with PS was observed for this sector of the mine, given by PS showing deformation rates concentrated along a structural corridor with faults, fractures, and folds related to the Carajas fault system. Though only ground-based radar measurements for wall benches of mine 1 were available for a short time period of the TSX-1 coverage, the PS movement patterns showed concordance with geotechnical field measurements. The investigation emphasized the important role that satellite-based A-DInSAR can play for deformation monitoring and risk assessment in this kind of mining area. © The Authors.

Mining operations in the area have significant areas of rock mass movements and surface displacements that potentially lead to slope instabilities with risks to personnel, equipment and production. Instabilities can be expected due to deep excavations in rock masses of low geomechanical quality, blasting practices and heavy precipitation. In this paper, ground instabilities are monitored through an integrated SAR analysis based on a data-stack of 33 TerraSAR-X images. This approach was designed to monitor distinct displacement regimes, ranging from small to high deformation rates, and to map surface changes, based on variations of radar reflectivity. Results were compared with field information (total station/prisms, ground based radar, geological and geomechanical maps), and the approach showed to be effective for monitoring ground deformation in the region. Due to its capabilities (synoptic view, high accuracy, dense grid sampling), the complementary use of space-based SAR with field monitoring systems proved to be strategic for operational mining planning and risk assessment in this challenging environment. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Blasting process causes deleterious effects on a mine and affects stability and pace of production if not properly designed and controlled. Mine productivity warrants for larger sized blasts while mine stability calls for imposing control measures to curb vibrations to acceptable level. The situation gets grim in the mines, specially the open pits, traversed with numerous prominent geological structures like faults, shears, etc. The blast damage inflicted upon such geological structures is difficult to be measured by conventional techniques like mapping, drilling core, etc. because of in-accessibility rendered to these fault site due to blast damage. In order to investigate response of such geological faults to blast vibrations circumventing these problems, applicability of slope stability radar deployed at Rampura Agucha mine (RAM) for slope stability monitoring was extended to capture sliding movement of faults also. During the investigation, three faults situated on hang wall of the RAM open pit were monitored for sliding movement caused by a number of blasts (20−30) carried out in their vicinity while the corresponding level of blast vibrations generated was calculated by predictor equation established in the area. Analysis of the instant observations revealed a definite threshold value of ground vibrations triggering the fault sliding across all the three experiments depicting consistency of the investigation. Secondly, with rise of level of ground vibrations, the magnitude of sliding movement increases linearly with varying degree of correlation. The results of current investigation would be of great value to designing control blast in other mines traversed with geological faults. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the spatiotemporal deformation characteristics and failure mechanism are still unknown. In this paper, the surface deformation time series from 2017 to 2020 is firstly estimated by combining multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and improved offset-tracking methods to overcome the difficulties caused by the large gradient surface deformation and surface material changes. Then, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Jianshanying landslide is analyzed in terms of line-of-sight (LOS) deformation with stacking InSAR method and two-dimensional (2D) deformation with improved SAR offset-tracking method. And the different deformation features between sliding body and surrounding areas are uncovered. Accordingly, we point out the “three-section” surface deformation model. We further analyze the deformation time series by considering the joint effects of rainfall and underground mining. Finally, we conceptualize the landslide failure mode for the Jianshanying landslide, which can be extended to the similar landslide in karst mountainous areas of southwestern China. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {With the gradual expansion of mining scale in open-pit coal mines, slope safety problems are increasingly diversified and complicated. In order to reduce the potential loss caused by slope sliding and reduce the major threat to the safety of life and property of residents in the mining area, this study selected two mining areas in Xinjiang as cases and focused on the relationship between phase noise and deformation. The study predicts the specific time point of slope sliding by analyzing the dynamic history correlation tangent angle between the two. Firstly, the time series data of the micro-variation monitoring radar are used to obtain the small deformation of the study area by differential InSAR (D-InSAR), and the phase noise is extracted from the radar echo in the sequence data. Then, the volume of the deformation body is calculated by analyzing the small deformation at each time point, and the standard deviation of the phase noise is calculated accordingly. Finally, the sliding time of the deformation body is predicted by combining the tangent angle of the ratio of the volume of the deformation body to the standard deviation of the phase noise. The results show that the maximum deformation rates of the deformation bodies in the studied mining areas reach 10.1 mm/h and 6.65 mm/h, respectively, and the maximum deformation volumes are 2,619,521.74 mm3 and 2,503,794.206 mm3, respectively. The predicted landslide time is earlier than the actual landslide time, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. This prediction method can effectively identify the upcoming sliding events and the characteristics of the slope, provide more accurate and reliable prediction results for the slope monitoring staff, and significantly improve the efficiency of slope monitoring and early warning. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slope failures are life-Threatening geohazards well-known in the mining industry, where a single accident can endanger workers and cause million dollars'-worth of activity downtime. Therefore, a detailed ground deformation map of an open-pit mine represents a vital planning tool and high-frequency monitoring is pivotal, since false or anticipated alarms may represent a higher impact than missed alarms. This article presents an application of interferometric satellite data from Sentinel-1. The scope of the study is showing the potential of the new generation of satellites for the detection of the boundary, typology, and kinematics of the on-going slope instabilities in open-pit mines. Most notably, this experience discloses how the short revisiting time (six days) permits the implementation of time of failure forecasting methods, which so far were a prerogative of ground-based monitoring systems. Only recently, a few experiences have shown the possibility of (a posteriori) predicting slope failures using displacement time series measured from satellite; the case study here described represents one of such first examples. Moreover, 11 other areas of instability have been detected and classified in terms of subsidence (sediment compaction) or slope failures, based on considerations concerning the acquisition geometry used to detect the movements. The movement vectors along the ascending and descending lines of sight have been combined to compute horizontal and vertical vectors, which have been employed to infer the geometry of the sliding surface of some selected slope instabilities. Despite the advancements of the technique, clear limitations still exist and are discussed in this article. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The slope at Zhahanur open-pit mine (China) has experienced significant and prolonged deformation, posing a considerable risk to life and property within the mining area. To analyse the deformation and failure mechanism of the rock slope, geotechnical investigations, numerical simulations, and long-term movement monitoring were undertaken. In order to improve the efficiency of slope pretreatment, a point elimination method was proposed for the slope surface, and a 3D geological model of mining area was established. A systematic analysis was performed on monitoring data from surface slope radar and underground inclinometers, enabling the identification of the potential sliding surface and deformation pattern of northern slope in a rational manner. Additionally, through three-dimensional numerical simulation, the feasibility of the mining scheme that incorporates waste dump inside the pit was explored. These simulations accurately captured the varying deformation patterns at different levels and exhibited good agreement with available field monitoring data. The findings revealed a composite multi-stage slope failure pattern primarily controlled by weak layers. The safety factors associated to two competing slip surfaces were determined to be 1.20 and 1.15, respectively. To ensure the safe extraction of coal resources from the deformed slope, a combined mining scheme of in-pit dumping and mining is proposed in the study. The proposed scheme was shown to meet the production needs, with a minimum safety factor of 1.08 for rock slope under the mining scheme. By integrating various field monitoring techniques with numerical simulations, a collaborative monitoring scheme was devised to effectively and promptly identify potential sliding surface and implement necessary mining and control measures to ensure slope stability. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the deformation behavior of the rock slope and facilitates the implementation of proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with slope instability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) has been used to monitor surface deformations in open pit mines and tailings dams. In this paper, ground deformations have been detected on the area of tailings Dam-I at the Córrego do Feijão Mine (Brumadinho, Brazil) before its catastrophic failure occurred on 25 January 2019. Two techniques optimized for different scattering models, SBAS (Small BAseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry), were used to perform the analysis based on 26 Sentinel-1B images in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, which were acquired on descending orbits from 03 March 2018 to 22 January 2019. A WorldDEM Digital Surface Model (DSM) product was used to remove the topographic phase component. The results provided by both techniques showed a synoptic and informative view of the deformation process affecting the study area, with the detection of persistent trends of deformation on the crest, middle, and bottom sectors of the dam face until its collapse, as well as the settlements on the tailings. It is worth noting the detection of an acceleration in the displacement time-series for a short period near the failure. The maximum accumulated displacements detected along the downstream slope face were −39 mm (SBAS) and −48 mm (PSI). It is reasonable to consider that Sentinel-1 would provide decision makers with complementary motion information to the in situ monitoring system for risk assessment and for a better understanding of the ongoing instability phenomena affecting the tailings dam. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Excavation and material stockpiling activities in the mining process cause a change in the distribution of forces and stresses in the material. As a result, the material will seek a new equilibrium by releasing the load through a landslide. As part of mitigation, it is necessary to monitor displacements occurring on slopes using high-accuracy devices. Ground-based radar is a technique considered to have good ability to detect displacements in real-time. However, ground-based radar has a weakness in that it cannot detect vertical displacement. One of the emerging technologies that is used for monitoring vertical displacements as LoS displacements is D-InSAR analysis. With the integration of both methods, displacements that occur horizontally and vertically on a slope can be detected properly. In addition, the decrease in rock mass strength due to displacement can be predicted based on numerical analysis using the finite element method. Monitoring was carried out from December 10th, 2021 to April 9th, 2022. The monitoring results from the beginning to the end of the period showed that the horizontal and vertical displacements that occurred in the low wall area were 1247.34 mm and 292.5 mm, respectively. Correlated with these conditions, the Young’s modulus value of the rock mass decreased between 3% and 35%. © 2023 Published by IRCS-ITB.},

	abstract = {Vertical deformation estimation can be a significant tool in preventing geological hazards and managing environment impacts of underground mining. Common ground surface vertical deformation calculations are challenged by difficult data collection and dependence on prior knowledge. SVD (singular value decomposition) method was applied to estimate ground surface vertical deformation from single pair SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data in a mining region. During the study, LOS (line of sight) and azimuth displacement was obtained using two pass D-InSAR (differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar) and MAI (multi-aperture radar interferometry) technology, respectively. Two adjustment equations were composed using the imaging geometry of D-InSAR and MAI. The singular value decomposition theorem was used to acquire M-P (Moore-Penrose) generalized inverse of the rank deficiency coefficient matrix. From this, the optimal approximation solution of unknown parameters was calculated using weighted least squares. A working panel in the Datong mining area, Shanxi province, China, was selected to verify the SVD approach using the two ascending Sentinel-1A data. The accuracy of vertical deformation estimated by SVD approach is reliable. The RMSE (root mean square error) of vertical deformation is 2.64 mm (along upright profile) and 4.95 mm (along horizontal profile). These results suggest that the SVD approach will complement widely used vertical ground surface deformation calculations. Further study is needed to validate the method from other deformation scenarios from landslides, groundwater loss, earthquakes, underground mining, and glacier movement. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {As underground coal mining activities are increasing in the southwestern mountainous areas of China, the geological safety issues related to ground subsidence and slope deformation have emerged as significant concerns. These issues have started to impact the routine mining operations. Monitoring deformation and analyzing the mechanical behavior of mining areas can help reveal the deformation patterns at surface level and on typical slopes in mountainous coalfields, ultimately reducing the risk of landslides. Taking the Guangfeng coal mine as a case study, this paper employs Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and numerical simulation to analyze the influence of surface deformation caused by underground mining activities on slope deformation. The InSAR results indicate the presence of two distinct subsidence areas, labeled as I and II. The maximum annual subsidence rate in area I reaches 72 mm/a, while area II shows an annual deformation rate of 59 mm/a. The subsidence around the mined-out area has triggered sliding deformation in the slopes, which aligns with the numerical simulation results obtained from the fast Lagrangian analysis of continua in three dimensions (FLAC3D). As mining advances further into the working face, greater tensile stress develops at the rear edge of the slope, causing the subsidence at the center of surface which gradually shifts towards the top of the slope. The process of slope deformation related to underground coal mining in mountainous regions can be divided into four stages: the original slope stage, the early stage of underground mining, the evolution stage of composite slope deformation, and the stage of increased surface subsidence in the slope. By combining InSAR technology with FLAC3D numerical simulations, surface movements in mountainous mining areas can be accurately and reliably monitored and analyzed. This approach provides effective guidance for deformation monitoring and prediction of slope stability in mining regions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

This collapse was the result of a developing instability that was first identified when the benches in this area were exposed during September 2002. The NOP geotechnical and survey departments closely monitored the development of the failure. Control measures were implemented to reduce risk to men and equipment These measures were continually improved and adjusted in reaction to observations and changing conditions. The purpose of this paper is to describe in detail the monitoring results that were obtained both by traditional methods and the novel slope stability radar system (SSR). Difficulties encountered in establishing critical deformation levels and deformation rates that can be used to predict the onset of collapse are described.

	abstract = {Persistent Scatterer interferometry (PSI) represents a powerful tool for the detection and monitoring of tiny surface deformations in vast areas, allowing a better understanding of its triggering mechanisms, planning of mitigation measures, as well as to find better solutions for social and environmental issues. However, there is no record hitherto of its use in active open pit mine in tropical rainforest environment. In this paper we evaluate the use of the PSI technique for the detection and monitoring of mine slope deformations in the N4W iron mine and its surroundings, ParáState, Northern Brazil. The PSI processing was performed with 18 ascending SAR scenes of the TerraSAR-X satellite acquired in the dry season of 2012. The results showed a significant number of widely distributed persistent scatterers. It was observed that most of the study area was stable during the time span. Nevertheless, high deformation rates (312 mm/year) were mapped over the mine waste piles, but do not offer any hazard, since they are expected displacements of meters in magnitude for these manmade land structures. Additionally, it was mapped tiny deformation rates in both the east and west flanks of pits 1 and 2. The main underlying reasons can be assigned to the accommodation phenomena of very poor rock masses, to the local geometric variations of the slope cuts, to the geological contact between ironstones and the country rocks, to the exploitation activities, as well as to the major geological structures. This study showed the applicability of the PSI technique using TerraSAR-X scenes in active open pit mines in tropical moist environment. However, the PSI technique is not capable in providing real-time warnings, and faces limitations due to SAR viewing geometry. In this sense, we strongly recommend the use of radar scenes acquired in both ascending and descending orbits, which would also provide a more complete understanding of the deformation patterns. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {European Remote Sensing satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are used to analyze terrain deformation in the area of Wieliczka, Poland using interferometric techniques. Terrain deformations in Wieliczka are due to (i) salt mining, (ii) catastrophic suffusion caused by water inflows to the mine and (iii) landslides in the southern part of the region. To discriminate between different deformation regimes differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) and persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) are used. A comparison with published information based on leveling data is performed. It can be concluded that rapid subsidence caused by catastrophic water inflow cannot be identified with InSAR techniques. However, both D-InSAR and PSI retrieve information about slow subsidence due to mine convergence. These data match with subsidence maps constructed from leveling data. A limited amount of coherent scatterers were identified on landslides. Some scatterers can be related to buildings with clear damage caused by landslide movement. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Displacement maps from multitemporal InSAR (MTI) are usually noisy and fragmented. Thresholding on ensemble coherence is a common practice for identifying radar scatterers that are less affected by decorrelation noise. Thresholding on coherence might, however, cause loss of information over the areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios. If the discrepancies in the areas of moderate coherence share similar behavior, it appears important to take into account their spatial correlation for correct inference. The information over low-coherent areas might then be used in a similar way the coherence is used in thematic mapping applications such as change detection. We propose an approach based on data mining and statistical procedures for mitigating the impact of outliers in MTI results. Our approach allows for minimization of outliers in final results while preserving spatial and statistical dependence among observations. Tests from monitoring slope failures and undermined areas performed in this work have shown that this is beneficial: 1) for better evaluation of lowcoherent scatterers that are commonly discarded by the standard thresholding procedure, 2) for tackling outlying observations with extremes in any variable, 3) for improving spatial densities of standard persistent scatterers, 4) for the evaluationof areas undergoing more complex deformation scenarios, and 5) for the visualization purposes. © 2017 IEEE.},

To this end, this article proposed a new machine-learning method for slope deformation prediction. Ground-based interferometric radar (GB-SAR) was employed to collect the slope deformation data from an open-pit mine. Then, an ensemble learner, which aggregated a set of weaker learners, was proposed to mine the GB-SAR field data, delivering a slope deformation prediction model. The evaluation of the field data acquired from the Anjialing open-pit mine demonstrates that the proposed slope deformation model was able to precisely predict the slope deformation of the monitored mine. The prediction accuracy of the super learner was superior to those of all the independent weaker learners. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Drone-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) analysis offers a simple and efficient technique for acquiring observational data from various research areas. However, fundamental research on observation techniques, including the investigation of drone flight parameters, remains insufficient. This study focuses on improving the resolution of intensity images of a single-look complex (SLC) via drone-based SAR observations. By conducting experiments at different flight speeds and analysing the obtained SLC images, we demonstrated that higher drone speeds resulted in enhanced image resolution under the conditions investigated at flight speeds of ≤ 5 m s−1. A comparison with satellite SAR images highlighted the superior performance of drone-based SAR in capturing topographic features. The analysis also suggested that factors including trajectory deviation and Doppler rate affected the resolution and azimuth position. The simulation results supported the experimental findings on the relationship between drone speed and resolution. Our results emphasize the potential of drone-based SAR observations for monitoring slope failures and suggest the importance of the drone flight parameter selection. In the future, drone-based SAR is expected to produce intensity images of slopes and locate slope deformations associated with blasting for mining and earthquakes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Dump sites with broken overburden layers in surface mines have the risk of instability due to their loose bulk structures. In this study, deformations at a dump site of the Kangal/Kalburçayırı open-pit coal mine and their long-term behaviours were revealed with InSAR data for a total period of 4.5 years. Firstly, 9-periods involving different time ranges were created considering the presence of LiCSAR products. Then, the deformation velocities of each period were calculated by LiCSBAS software using LiCSAR products. The area where high deformations were concentrated from the LiCSBAS result products was determined and divided into 4 zones for more detailed evaluations. At the final stage, the period-deformation velocity graphs were drawn separately for each zone with the data obtained using two different approaches from the deformation velocities of all periods, and long-term deformation behaviours were determined. More reliable future behaviour projections could be made considering the current increasing or decreasing trend of deformation behaviours. It was revealed that vertical deformations at the dump site had an increasing trend in the first periods and a decreasing trend in the later periods. Maximum vertical deformation velocities ranging between −111.4 mm/year and −178.0 mm/year in the first 4 months reached the highest values (ranging from −141.9 mm/year to −261.8 mm/year) at the end of two years and decreased to values ranging from −33.0 mm/year to −44.3 mm/year in the later periods. It was found that horizontal deformation velocities ranged between +0.5 mm/year and +55.4 mm/year in the east–west direction and between −7.0 mm/year and −56.8 mm/year in the west-east direction, were approximately 5 times lower than vertical velocities and did not have a constantly increasing or decreasing trend in any direction. It was observed that deformations exhibited a behaviour resulting from the structural property of the dump bulk material. The results of the evaluations showed that the risk of instability gradually decreased at the dump site. The methodology of this study can enable the determination of similar areas that may pose a threat in a short time, the prioritization of risky areas, the planning of more detailed studies, and taking the necessary measures in a timely manner. © 2023 COSPAR},

This paper proposes an approach to carry out an open pit’s overall and whole-process mechanical analysis with complex geological conditions, using precise modeling and large-scale parallel calculation techniques. Taking the Fushun West Open-pit Mine (the largest open-pit coal mine in Asia) as an example, through the elaborate multi-method geological investigation, the interfaces of interbedded shales and mudstones, the unloading zones, and the small structures were identified, a detailed 3D geological model was built and finely meshed in full-size with 100 million degrees of freedom, large-scale parallel numerical simulation was then performed, the results agree well with the InSAR monitoring data and in situ observations. Besides, the simulation can replicate the landslides in recent years. Through the simulation, it is possible to locate the potential landslide area, and targeted backfilling schemes for stability treatment were put forward and further simulated.

A large number of Sentinel-1 SAR images have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas, detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {New government policy in China has facilitated research on the hazards in open-pit mine slopes. Remote sensing, geological, geophysical, and computer simulation techniques have been applied to obtain better information in slope investigation. In this study, we investigated the slope of the Qianlingshan open-pit mine area in Beijing, China. Electrical resistivity tomography and ground-penetrating radar were used, and the results were compared with borehole data to ascertain the slope structure, potential slip surface, and deformation zone. A geological model of the slope was established, and the slope stability was analyzed by numerical simulation. The results showed that the slope had an unstable surface layer over bedrock, and probable creep sliding-tension deformation. In addition, the slope would become less stable in wet conditions. The geological methods used in this study will provide a useful reference for further slope stability analysis and prevention. We took the Qianlingshan open-pit slope in Beijing, China, as the research object, by comprehensive application of historical remote sensing images analysis, field investigation, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR), and comparative analysis with borehole data, to obtain the slope parameter such as resistivity and velocity of electromagnetic wave, and to ascertain the slope structure, potential slip surface and deformation zone. On this basis, the geological generalisation model of slope was established, and the failure mechanism and stability of slope were analyzed by numerical simulation. © 2023 Australian Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

	abstract = {The collapse of open-pit coal mine slopes is a kind of severe geological hazard that may cause resource waste, economic loss, and casualties. On 22 February 2023, a large-scale collapse occurred at the Xinjing Open-Pit Mine in Inner Mongolia, China, leading to the loss of 53 lives. Thus, monitoring of the slope stability is important for preventing similar potential damage. It is difficult to fully obtain the temporal and spatial information of the whole mining area using conventional ground monitoring technologies. Therefore, in this study, multi-source remote sensing methods, combined with local geological conditions, are employed to monitor the open-pit mine and analyze the causes of the accident. Firstly, based on GF-2 data, remote sensing interpretation methods are used to locate and analyze the collapse area. The results indicate that high-resolution remote sensing can delineate the collapse boundary, supporting the post-disaster rescue. Subsequently, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1A satellite data, covering the period from mining to collapse, are integrated with D-InSAR and DS-InSAR technologies to monitor the deformation of both the collapse areas and the potential risk to dump slopes. The D-InSAR result suggests that high-intensity open-pit mining may be the dominant factor affecting deformation. Furthermore, the boundary between the collapse trailing edge and the non-collapse area could be found in the DS-InSAR result. Moreover, various data sources, including DEM and geological data, are combined to analyze the causes and trends of the deformation. The results suggest that the dump slopes are stable. Meanwhile, the deformation trends of the collapse slope indicate that there may be faults or joint surfaces of the collapse trailing edge boundary. The slope angle exceeding the designed value during the mining is the main cause of the collapse. In addition, the thawing of soil moisture caused by the increase in temperature and the reduction in the mechanical properties of the rock and soil due to underground voids and coal fires also contributed to the accident. This study demonstrates that multi-source remote sensing technologies can quickly and accurately identify potential high-risk areas, which is of great significance for pre-disaster warning and post-disaster rescue. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Toppling failure of rock slopes is a complicated mode due to a combination of both continuous and discontinuous deformation, especially in dealing with anti-dip rock slopes. In this paper, a novel continuum-based discrete element method (CDEM), which is useful in modeling the entire progressive process from continuous to discontinuous deformation, is proposed to analyze the deformation characteristics, the failure mechanism and the evolution process of a large-scale open pit slope with a typical anti-dip structure. To simulate the slope deformation, the shear strength reduction method (SSR) is adopted to represent the strength degradation of rock mass in the deterioration process. The simulated results are validated using data obtained from a field investigation and continuous monitoring by employing an advanced remote sensing technique called ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (GB-InSAR). To analyze the evolution trend of the anti-dip slope, the subsequent toppling failure mode is predicted using the validated CDEM models. Based on a case study of a slope at the Fushun open pit mine (in Fushun, China), the unique geological structure with various joints and discontinuities, groundwater, intense rainfall, and mining activities are identified as the main triggers for different failure stages. The comparison between the field data and the simulation shows that CDEM accurately depicts the rock deformation and the failure pattern of the studied slope. The proposed numerical modeling techniques can be used for predicting failures of other similar excavated rock slopes. The simulated evolution process and the recorded deformation patterns help engineers to gain a better understanding of rock mass movement of anti-dip slopes, and the presented methodology could be utilized for similar studies and engineering designs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Block caving often leads to significant ground deformations that if not properly assessed and accounted for may threaten the integrity and safety of overlying mine infrastructure. To mitigate this risk, sophisticated 3-D numerical modelling has been turned to as a means of predicting the extent and magnitudes of caving-induced surface subsidence. However, the complexity of the rock mass interactions involved, coupled with the uncertainty associated with geological heterogeneity, rock mass properties and in-situ stresses results in the need for models to be constrained and calibrated. Results are first presented here from a detailed 3-D back analysis of a caving-induced open pit mine slope failure, used to constrain the rock mass properties and far-field in-situ stresses derived from field characterisation data, as well as to bring understanding to the problem with respect to the cave-pit interactions. The "best fit" set of input properties obtained was then used for forward modelling of caving-induced subsidence for the period 2009-2010. Further calibration of this model was performed using high-resolution InSAR monitoring data. The close fit achieved between the predictive 3-D numerical model and InSAR data demonstrates the promise of InSAR as a means to calibrate sophisticated numerical models, and thereby contribute to managing block caving associated subsidence hazards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Satellite interferometric data are widely exploited for ground motion monitoring thanks to their wide area coverage, cost efficiency and non-invasiveness. The launch of the Sentinel-1 constellation opened new horizons for interferometric applications, allowing the scientists to rethink the way in which these data are delivered, passing from a static view of the territory to a continuous streaming of ground motion measurements from space. Tuscany Region is the first worldwide example of a regional scale monitoring system based on satellite interferometric data. The processing chain here exploited combines a multi-interferometric approach with a time-series data mining algorithm aimed at recognizing benchmarks with significant trend variations. The system is capable of detecting the temporal changes of a wide variety of phenomena such as slow-moving landslides and subsidence, producing a high amount of data to be interpreted in a short time. Bulletins and reports are derived to the hydrogeological risk management actors at regional scale. The final output of the project is a list of potentially hazardous and accelerating phenomena that are verified on site by field campaign by completing a sheet survey in order to qualitatively estimate the risk and to suggest short-term actions to be taken by local entities. Two case studies, one related to landslides and one to subsidence, are proposed to highlight the potential of the monitoring system to early detect anomalous ground changes. Both examples represent a successful implementation of satellite interferometric data as monitoring and risk management tools, raising the awareness of local and regional authorities to geohazards. © 2019 by the authors},

First, the subtraction of SRTM DEM (2000) from TanDEM-X DEM (2010–2015) has identified two major accumulation areas, one in the east (+112.33 m) and the other in the west (+84.03 m), and a major excavation area (−42.54 m) at the center of the mine. A total of 89 high-quality coherence images with a 12-day baseline from 2015 to 2020 were converted to the normalized difference activity index (NDAI), a newly developed activity indicator robust to spatial and temporal decorrelation. An RGB composite of annually averaged NDAI maps (red for 2019, green for 2018, and blue for 2017) showed that overall activity has diminished since 2018. Dumping slopes were categorized into shrinking, expanding, or transitional, according to the color pattern. Migration and expansion of excavation sites were also found on the pit floor. Time series of 12-day NDAI graphs revealed the date of activities with monthly accuracy. It is believed that NDAI with continuous acquisition of Sentinel-1A/B data can provide detailed monitoring of various types of activities in open-pit mines especially with limited in situ data. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Okgye limestone mine, which is the largest open-pit limestone mine located in a mountainous area in Korea, suffered a collapse in 2012 that claimed four casualties. Restoration work on the rocky mined-out slopes, as well as mining and dumping activities, are still in progress. Monitoring slope stability is important to prevent the sudden collapse of slopes, which can be efficiently performed by satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. Firstly, we obtained elevation changes using InSAR-generated Copernicus 30 m DEM in 2014 and an SRTM 1Sec DEM in 2000, through which the area was roughly classified into the mining area, tailings storage area, and the mined-out area. A time series of 12-day coherence images produced by Sentinel-1B SAR were averaged annually to produce an RGB-composite image to observe the change in mining activities during 2018, 2019, and 2020. We found many persistent scatterers (PS) when observing the ground displacement, both in the ascending and descending orbits, from which we decomposed this into the vertical and east components. The largest displacement of 63.6 mm/year was observed during 2019 and 2020 in the tailings storage area in the direction of the dumping slope. For the rocky outcrops and the transmission tower, we found a seasonal oscillation, which can be interpreted as the thermal expansion of limestone and iron. This paper demonstrated that the surface stability and deformation of open-pit mines could be effectively monitored by combining InSAR DEM, coherence, and PSInSAR techniques. © 2022 by the authors.},

Mining companies are searching for new possibilities of optimizing and automating processes, as well as for using digital technology and modern computer software to aid technological processes. Every stage of deposit management requires mining engineers, geologists, surveyors, and environment protection specialists who are involved in acquiring, storing, processing, and sharing data related to the parameters describing the deposit, its exploitation and the environment. These data include inter alia: geometries of the deposit, of the excavations, of the overburden and of the mined mineral, borders of the support pillars and of the buffer zones, mining advancements with respect to the set borders, effects of mining activities on the ground surface, documentation of landslide hazards and of the impact of mining operations on the selected elements of the environment. Therefore, over the life cycle of a deposit, modern digital technological solutions should be implemented in order to automate the processes of acquiring, sharing, processing and analyzing data related to deposit management. In accordance with this idea, the article describes the results of a measurement experiment performed in the Mikoszów open-pit granite mine (Lower Silesia, SW Poland) with the use of mobile LiDAR systems.

	abstract = {In order to prevent landslide and collapse in the mining area, it is essential not only to gain a full understanding of the surface deformation information about the open-pit mining area and surrounding dumps, but also to closely monitor the development of surface deformation. Small baseline set (SBAS) technology can be applied to extract the high-resolution spatial-temporal deformation information from the mining areas. Due to decoherence, however, it is difficult to obtain the effective information on deformation from some areas where the results are monitored. This paper proposes a kriging interpolation method that performs better in filling the missing values in the InSAR monitored results by integrating GPS measured data with InSAR monitored data. In the experimental process, 69 Sentinel-1 image data were collected from July 2018 to November 2020. The SBAS-InSAR technology was applied to monitor the surface deformation caused to the Kunyang phosphate mining area and surrounding dumping sites. It was found out that all the mining areas across the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine and the surrounding dumps suffered severe surface deformation, with the maximum line of sight (LOS) deformation rate of −132 mm/yr located in the dump in the north of the second mining area. The verification result shows that InSAR measurement results are consistent with the deformation estimated from GPS measurements. The root mean square error of most points is maintained within ±10 mm. The Kriging interpolation results of fusion GPS data are in good agreement with the GPS results. The root mean square errors at the 4 verification points are ±6.2 mm, ±4.6 mm, ±6.4 mm, ±7.8 mm. The method proposed in this paper is effective in filling in the missing values in the incoherent area, and can be applied to mine surface deformation monitoring with high reliability. The results of this paper serve as a scientific basis for the prevention and control of landslides, collapses and other hidden risks of geological disasters posed by the mining operations conducted in the Kunyang Phosphorus Mine. © 2022 COSPAR},

	abstract = {Slope failures frequently occur in open-pit mines, resulting in significant losses. Identifying the precursory displacements and triggering factors for detecting unstable slopes is critical for reducing and preventing their impact. This study proposes combining satellite radar interferometry and infrared thermography with numerical simulation to determine unstable slopes in an open-pit mine. First, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is utilized to capture deformation information in a line-of-sight direction in terms of velocity to locate the long-time movement on a large scale. The application of infrared thermography enables the detection of peculiar features based on the different thermal patterns occurring along the slope and the interpretation of critical sectors matching with the instability zones highlighted by the InSAR. In particular, areas with various surface temperatures were associated with vegetated spots, new benches, bare sectors, and contact between different lithologies. By means of three-dimensional stability analyses, the associated interferometry movement confirmed the slope instability, and a critical failure surface was found using two-dimensional numerical simulation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through a massive slope failure in the Qidashan open-pit mine in Liaoning, China. It predicts the slope failures caused by intense rainfall and reveals the progressive failure mechanism. The practical application has demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach for detecting failure precursors, providing a novel procedure for remotely identifying critical slopes in an open-pit with frequent mining activity.

Based on the results of the field survey, it was found that the actual engineering slope angle exceeded the standard, emerging as the main factor triggering the landslide in the Xinjing mine.

	abstract = {Displacement monitoring in open-pit mines is one of the important tasks for safe management of mining processes. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), mounted on an artificial satellite, has the potential to be a cost-effective method for monitoring surface displacements over extensive areas, such as open-pit mines. DInSAR requires the ground surface elevation data in the process of its analysis as a digital elevation model (DEM). However, since the topography of the ground surface in open-pit mines changes largely due to excavations, measurement errors can occur due to insufficient information on the elevation of mining areas. In this paper, effect of different elevation models on the accuracy of the displacement monitoring results by DInSAR is investigated at a limestone quarry. In addition, validity of the DInSAR results using an appropriate DEM is examined by comparing them with the results obtained by global positioning system (GPS) monitoring conducted for three years at the same limestone quarry. It is found that the uncertainty of DEMs induces large errors in the displacement monitoring results if the baseline length of the satellites between the master and the slave data is longer than a few hundred meters. Comparing the monitoring results of DInSAR and GPS, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the discrepancy between the two sets of results is less than 10 mm if an appropriate DEM, considering the excavation processes, is used. It is proven that DInSAR can be applied for monitoring the displacements of mine slopes with centimeter-level accuracy. © 2020 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

	abstract = {GB-InSAR, with high time-spatial resolution and high accuracy, shows great potential in landslide monitoring. However, the accuracy of GB-InSAR is usually reduced by the atmospheric disturbance and temporal decorrelation. PS-InSAR technology can solve those problems well and get accurate deformation information, so it has been widely adopted in space-borne SAR. For the atmospheric correction, PS-InSAR assumes that the atmospheric phase is only strongly correlated in the space domain. But for GB-InSAR, atmospheric phase shows correlation in both the time and space domains, because of the short time interval. Therefore, the calculation of linear velocity will be affected by the atmospheric disturbance when the PS-InSAR technology is applied to the GB-SAR data. To solve this problem, a PS-InSAR strategy for GB-SAR data considering the atmospheric disturbance in the time domain is proposed. The proposed method uses the differential interferograms interfered by nearby SLCs to ensure the high coherence of interferometric phase and reduces the impact of atmospheric disturbance. The coherence is used for PS selection besides the amplitude deviation index, which can increase the density of PS points. Furthermore, a method for atmospheric correction based on the wrapped phase is presented. Thus, the linear velocity is computed based on the interferogram without most atmospheric disturbance. The validation using the data of the open pit in Malanzhuang, Hebei, China, shows that the proposed method can get a deformation monitoring accuracy of sub-millimeter. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

It has the advantages of high monitoring accuracy, a wide range, and flexibility allowing all-weather continuous monitoring. The self-developed S-SAR synthetic aperture radar (slope radar) is the first completely domestic-made radar used in slope deformation monitoring equipment in China, and its performance and technical parameters are equal to or better than similar products made abroad. The characteristics of deformation data collected by S-SAR slope radar deployed in the front open pit mine are analyzed to further develop a spatio-temporal landslide prediction method which is applicable to the massive monitoring data within the monitoring range of slope radar. The intersection points of short-term moving average velocity curve and long-term moving average velocity curve of slope deformation, which are onset of acceleration (OOA) and termination of acceleration (TOA). When OOA occurs, the deformation will accelerate, and when TOA occurs, the deformation will tend to stabilize. The OOA can identify areas at risk in the monitored area before failure, so that the spatial position prediction of landslide early warning can be realized. Based on the assumptions of the inverse velocity method, a T-log (t) logarithmic model is established, and the updated monitoring data are corrected to approximate the time of failure, thus improving the accuracy of landslide location and time prediction.

	abstract = {Slope failures, subsidence, earthworks, consolidation of waste dumps, and erosion are typical active deformation processes that pose a significant hazard in current and abandoned mining areas, given their considerable potential to produce damage and affect the population at large. This work proves the potential of exploiting space-borne InSAR and airborne LiDAR techniques, combined with data inferred through a simple slope stability geotechnical model, to obtain and update inventory maps of active deformations in mining areas. The proposed approach is illustrated by analyzing the region of Sierra de Cartagena-La Union (Murcia), a mountainous mining area in southeast Spain. Firstly, we processed Sentinel-1 InSAR imagery acquired both in ascending and descending orbits covering the period from October 2016 to November 2021. The obtained ascending and descending deformation velocities were then separately post-processed to semi-automatically generate two active deformation areas (ADA) maps by using ADATool. Subsequently, the PS-InSAR LOS displacements of the ascending and descending tracks were decomposed into vertical and east-west components. Complementarily, open-access, and non-customized LiDAR point clouds were used to analyze surface changes and movements. Furthermore, a slope stability safety factor (SF) map was obtained over the study area adopting a simple infinite slope stability model. Finally, the InSAR-derived maps, the LiDAR-derived map, and the SF map were integrated to update a previously published landslides’ inventory map and to perform a preliminary classification of the different active deformation areas with the support of optical images and a geological map. Complementarily, a level of activity index is defined to state the reliability of the detected ADA. A total of 28, 19, 5, and 12 ADAs were identified through ascending, descending, horizontal, and vertical InSAR datasets, respectively, and 58 ADAs from the LiDAR change detection map. The subsequent preliminary classification of the ADA enabled the identification of eight areas of consolidation of waste dumps, 11 zones in which earthworks were performed, three areas affected by erosion processes, 17 landslides, two mining subsidence zone, seven areas affected by compound processes, and 23 possible false positive ADAs. The results highlight the effectiveness of these two remote sensing techniques (i.e., InSAR and LiDAR) in conjunction with simple geotechnical models and with the support of orthophotos and geological information to update inventory maps of active deformation areas in mining zones. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Soil instability is a major hazard facing the mining industry in its role of supplying the indispensable mineral resources that our societal challenges require. Aiming to demonstrate the monitoring potential of radar satellites in the mining sector, we analyze the deformation field in the Riotinto mine, Spain. We propose a new method for combining ascending and descending results into a common dataset that provides better resolution. We project the LOS measurements resulting from both geometries to a common reference system without applying any type of geometric restriction. As a projection system, we use the vertical direction in flat areas and the slope in steep topographies. We then identify and remove outliers and artifacts from the joint dataset to finally obtain a deformation map that combines the two acquisition perspectives. The results in the Atalaya pit are consistent with GNSS measurements. The movements observed in the rock dumps were unknown before this study. We demonstrate the great potential of the Sentinel-1 satellite as a complementary tool for monitoring systems in mining environments and we call for its use to be standardized to guarantee a safe and sustainable supply of mineral resources necessary for a just technological transition. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Bedding-controlled landslides are a common geological hazard for open-pit metal mines and occur on layered rock slopes. It can spread spatially over the final boundary of the dip slope and persist throughout the entire life cycle of the mine, substantially compromising the safety of mining operations. Identifying potential landslide areas and determining the landslide mechanism is crucial for the safety production and slope management of mines. This study proposes a combination of satellite radar interferometry measurement and numerical simulation to determine the landslide mechanism of the bedding-controlled slope in open-pit mines. First, the multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) technique of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used to capture deformation information in the vertical and east–west directions of the slope, locate large-scale and long-term movements, and preliminarily determine the trend of landslides. Then, a layered slope damage constitutive model is established, and a three-dimensional stability calculation of the layered slope is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software based on the strength reduction method to study the development and evolution process of landslides. The effectiveness of the method is validated by a large-scale bedding-controlled slope failure in the Nanfen open-pit mine in Liaoning, China, revealing the failure mechanism of the slope under excavation conditions. The study shows that the eastern slope bedding-controlled landslide in the Nanfen open-pit mine is a multizone composite-mode landslide caused by excavation, which belongs to the shear–slip–tension deformation failure mechanism as a whole. This study provides a new method for analyzing the mechanism of layered rock slope landslides under mining activities in open-pit mines, which can be used to assess and predict similar landslides. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Multiseam mining in gully regions has resulted in severe and complex disaster chains, including crack development, mountain landslides, river blockage, and intensified mine water inflow. To prevent and control water inrush disasters, it is imperative to investigate the characteristics and mechanizations of overburden failure under the combined effect of gully terrain and repeated mining in coal seams. This study takes multiseam mining within the gully region of the Xiqu Coal Mine as a case study. The comprehensive analytical method that integrates surface exploration, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement, numerical simulation, and rainfall-runoff analysis, is used to anatomize the entire process of overburden failure induced by downward multiseam mining and the accumulation process of runoff in the gully region. The results reveal that compared to single-seam mining activities, repeated mining and the occurrence of key stratum (KS) structure failure triggered the comprehensive subsidence of the interburden, producing a cutting-type fracture and stepped subsidence, while the overburden exhibited severe damage. Compared to gentle surface topography, gully slopes are prone to shear sliding under the effects of mining subsidence and gravity, resulting in the connection of the downward cracks of the slope and the upward cracks of the overburden. In addition, if the accumulation formed by gully landslides due to repeated mining blocks the river channel and forms a barrier lake during the flood season, it may cause a surge in underground water. High-precision terrain synthesized by UAV tilt photogrammetry is used to simulate the rainfall inundation range and time of different durations during the “100-year return period” rainstorm in the study area. This study proposes a zoning prevention and control method for surface runoff disasters based upon the characteristics of surface deformation and surface inundation time; this method involves filling surface cracks in runoff areas and submerged and crack development areas, implementing slope cutting and control in potential landslide areas, and strengthening the riverbed in submerged and maximum settlement areas. © 2023},

	abstract = {The settlement (or subsidence) of mine waste dump is likely to cause landslides, thereby imposing threats on the safety of human beings and other local properties. Hence, it is essential to accurately predict the settlement for the early-warning of settlement-induced geohazards. Traditional mechanical methods require in situ mechanical parameters and the geological structure of mine waste dump, narrowing their practical applications. In this paper, we proposed a remote sensing-based method for predicting the settlement of mine waste dump without the requirement for field observations. Firstly, the historical settlement and thickness of mine waste dump were measured by space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and photogrammetry techniques, respectively. Secondly, the temporal evolution of the settlement of mine waste dump was described by a secondary consolidation model. Thirdly, the parameters of the secondary consolidation model were inverted based on the InSAR-measured historical settlements and photogrammetry-estimated thickness. Finally, the evolution trend of the settlement of the mine waste dump was predicted with the secondary consolidation model and its inverted parameters. The proposed method was tested over a mine waste dump in Weijiamao open-pit mine, China. The result shows that the root mean square error of the predicted time-series settlement is about 0.8 cm. The presented method will be beneficial to the assessment and early-warning of the settlement-related geohazards of mine waste dumps over a large area.

	abstract = {A considerable number of coal mines employed room and pillar mining in the last century in northern China, where the goaf remained stable for a period of time; however, with the increased exposure of coal pillars, their collapse may gradually increase. The stability assessment of these old rooms and pillar goafs is challenging due to their concealment, irregular mining patterns, and the long passage of time. The methodology developed in this study, based on “space-sky-earth” remote sensing such as InSAR to trace historical deformation, the UAV observation of current surface damage, and comparison of mining spaces, can rapidly detect on a large scale the collapse of old goafs and the trend of damage. This study is conducted with an example of a coal mine in Yulin, Northern China, where obtained quantitative surface deformation values were integrated with qualitative surface damage interpretation results, followed by a yearly analysis of the overlying rock movement in accordance with the underground coal mining process. The results show that from 2007 to 2021, corresponding surface deformation and damage occurred following mining progress. However, the room and pillar goaf areas had not undergone any surface deformation, nor had there been incidents of landslides or ground fissures; therefore, it was speculated that no roof collapse had occurred in this region. The surface deformation and damage associated with underground coal mining are complex and influenced by the coal seam occurrence, mining methods, strata lithology, terrain slope, temporal evolution, and anthropogenic modifications. These phenomena are representative of the coal mining area, and this methodology can provide a reference for similar endeavors. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slope monitoring plays an important role in the risk management of large open pit slopes. Historically, displacement data derived from measuring geodetic prisms have been relied upon to delineate the boundaries of potential slope hazards; however that data can be limited by its point-measurement nature. Localized displacements at each prism may be misinterpreted when extended to the behavior of the entire slope, and important displacements between prisms may be overlooked. New technologies like ground-based radar can provide high resolution, full area coverage of a slope in combination with near real-time acquisition and millimeter precision. As a line-of-sight instrument, these tools provide data on displacement magnitudes and rates, but not true direction hence limiting their use in gaining understanding of the kinematics and behavior of the moving slope. This paper describes a novel experiment in which two ground-based synthetic aperture radar systems were simultaneously deployed to record continuous, line-of-sight displacements of an open pit slope in "stereo". The displacement vectors were combined to create a pseudo 3-D displacement map for the slope, which was subsequently used to interpret the influence of a major fault and the rock mass fabric in promoting different kinematic responses. The data collected demonstrates that an improved understanding of the 3-D kinematics of a large rock slope can be achieved using advanced state-of-the-art monitoring techniques to aid mine design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) interferograms contain a large amount of phase noise. The existing methods lose effective deformation information to varying degrees upon filtering, which seriously reduces the monitoring accuracy of GB-SAR. In this paper, a GB-SAR interferogram filtering method for open-pit mines is studied. First, permanent scatterer points (PSPs) are extracted through coarse filtering, and the distribution of the noise phase is analysed. Then, an improved Grubbs outlier discrimination criterion is introduced considering the uncertainty of the PSP distribution. A method based on the eight-neighbourhood outlier discrimination (EOD) criterion is proposed to identify noise points. High-coherence points (HCPs) are used to reconstruct the phase of the noise points to filter the GB-SAR interferogram. Finally, the filtering effect is quantitatively evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). The superiority of the proposed filtering method in the image displacement region is verified based on simulated and real deformation data. The results show that the proposed method can accurately filter out the phase noise of interferograms and improve the accuracy of GB-SAR for slope monitoring. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The western part of Guizhou is located in the second step of East Asia. Although the area is stratigraphically continuous and the surface is dominated by hard limestone and sandstone, catastrophic landslides often occur, seriously threatening residents' lives and the safety of property. Accurate identification of landslides and analysis of their developmental patterns are vital to prevent and reduce the threat of geological disasters. No active landslide survey data cover this region, so this paper identifies the active landslides in the western part of Guizhou by combining surface deformation information, multitemporal optical remote sensing images, geological lithology, and geomorphic features to obtain deformation information from multisource synthetic aperture radar surface data. This process increases the accuracy and reliability of identifying unstable slopes in areas with dense vegetation and steep terrain. By processing 283 Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar data, 578 active landslides, 18 of which are high-risk large-scale landslides (landslide groups), are delineated for the first time in a range of 4.64 × 104 km2 in the study area. The active landslides mainly include natural landslides, reservoir landslides, and mining-induced landslides, accounting for 2.4%, 4.2 %, and 93.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of landslides is banded along the cuesta at the edge of an outcrop of coal strata. Landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1800–2000 m, with an elevation difference of 50 ~ 100 m and a slope range of 35° ~ 40°. The landslides are characterized by steep slopes, small scales, mass occurrences, and no dominant slope direction, classifying them as cuesta landslides induced by mining disturbance. Furthermore, nuanced remote sensing interpretation of the disaster elements, such as cuesta cliff, tensile cracks, deep and sizeable tensile channels, isolated rock masses, and collapse debris, and their processes of change, reveals that coal mining-disturbed landslides in this region have experienced four primary stages: natural unloading, mining disturbance, displacement acceleration, and slope failure. This is of great significance for understanding the genetic mechanism and developmental patterns, as well as the risk assessment, of this region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GBSAR) has the advantage of retrieving submillimeter deformation of the mine slope by using the differential interferometry technique, which is important for safe production in mining applications. However, the moving vehicle’s defocus/displaced signal will mask the SAR image of the mining area which affects the accuracy of interference phase extraction and deformation inversion. In order to remove its influence, the moving target can first be refocused and then removed. To our knowledge, there is no GBSAR moving target refocusing method currently. Hence, the refocusing method is necessary. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a single-channel FMCW-GBSAR moving target refocusing method based on relative speed. Firstly, the FMCW-GBSAR moving target signal model is analyzed, and then the relative speed based signal model is deduced. Based on the model and GBSAR’s feature of incomplete synthetic aperture, the Range Doppler (RD) algorithm is adopted and improved to achieve refocusing using relative speed parameters. The algorithm is controlled by relative speed and squint angle; thus, the refocused target image can be obtained via searching 2D parameters. The proposed method is verified by the synthetic data, which are generated by combining NCUT FMCW GBSAR real data and simulated moving target echo. © 2022 by the authors.},

Frank Slide is a rock avalanche that occurred on the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain in 1903 and claimed more than 70 lives. At the foot of the eastern slope of Turtle Mountain, the ground surface above the Frank Mine was found to subside at an average rate of about 3.1 mm per year, relative to the reference area that is located in the middle part of the Frank Slide, during a period from April 2004 to October 2006. This may support the speculation, suggested for more than 100 years since the Frank landslide took place, that ground movements induced by the underground coal mines at the foot of Turtle Mountain might have triggered the slide. To the east of the Frank Slide debris, an average subsidence rate of up to 3.2 mm per year was observed for some areas overlying the footprint of the abandoned Bellevue underground mine during the same period.

	abstract = {Landslides pose significant geohazards in both mining and natural slopes, necessitating effective temporal prediction of failure for slope-scale mitigation. The conventional understanding of creep behavior, derived from controlled laboratory testing, often falls short in explaining the dynamic in-situ creep characteristics of heterogeneous soil slopes. This study presents in-situ creep assessments through continuous displacement monitoring of an inactive coal mine waste dump, employing Ground-Based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GBInSAR). This study explores the applicability of the inverse velocity (IV) method for landslide failure prediction. Additionally, it evaluates the performance of two widely adopted filters, namely, moving average and exponential smoothing. In contrast to prior findings, the study reveals a distinct pattern in the IV vs. time curve, transitioning from an initial linear trend to a new steady-state. Notably, the research highlights instances of false predictions, underscoring the importance of considering potential stick–slip behavior, particularly in dump slopes. Furthermore, the findings on tension crack formation and propagation offer insights crucial for selecting an appropriate constitutive model tailored to the characteristics of the waste dump.

	abstract = {With the recent progress in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, especially the new generation of SAR satellites (Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X), our ability to assess slope stability in open-pit mines has significantly improved. The main objective of this work is to map ground displacement and slope instability over three open-pit mines, namely, Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden, in the Rhenish coalfields of Germany to provide long-term monitoring solutions for open-pit mining operations and their surroundings. Three SAR datasets, including Sentinel-1A data in ascending and descending orbits and TerraSAR-X data in a descending orbit, were processed by a modified small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm, called coherence-based SBAS, to retrieve ground displacement related to the three open-pit mines and their surroundings. Despite the continuously changing topography over these active open-pit mines, the small perpendicular baselines of both Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X data were not affected by DEM errors and hence could yield accurate estimates of surface displacement. Significant land subsidence was observed over reclaimed areas, with rates exceeding 500 mm/yr, 380 mm/yr, and 310 mm/yr for the Hambach, Garzweiler and Inden mine, respectively. The compaction process of waste materials is the main contributor to land subsidence. Land uplift was found over the areas near the active working parts of the mines, which was probably due to excavation activities. Horizontal displacement retrieved from the combination of ascending and descending data was analysed, revealing an eastward movement with a maximum rate of ∼120 mm/yr on the western flank and a westward movement with a maximum rate of ∼ 60 mm/yr on the eastern flank of the pit. Former open-pit mines Fortuna-Garsdorf and Berghein in the eastern part of Rhenish coalfields, already reclaimed for agriculture, also show subsidence, at locations reaching 150 mm/yr. The interferometric results were compared, whenever possible, with groundwater information to analyse the possible reasons for ground deformation over the mines and their surroundings. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Accelerated deformation and slope instability commonly occur within open-pit mines, indicating the action of potential triggering events such as mining disturbances or rainfall. However, limited studies have been conducted on the deformation behavior of open-pit slopes subjected to the combined effects of mining blasting and rainfall infiltration. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), coupled numerical analyses, and field monitoring for systematic evaluation of the deformation behavior and failure characteristic of a massive landslide that occurred on November 8, 2019 in the Qidashan open-pit mine, China. The InSAR data were reviewed aiming at characterizing the surface deformation fields over the mine site via small baseline subsets technique, as well as identifying unstable slopes and revealing their high susceptibility to mining operations and rainfall. Finite-difference modeling was performed to investigate the response mechanisms and factor of safety of the unstable slope, which were validated by using field data monitored with the global navigation satellite system. The simulation results indicate that the Qidashan landslides were triggered by intense rainfall causing a gradual reduction of shear strength, and mining activities promoted failure by providing stress relaxation and blasting disturbance. Furthermore, this study contributes critical insight into the identification of deformation and early warning of unstable slopes in frequent mining environments, and allows for a back-analysis of the failure mechanism of landslide reactivation. This study highlights how important it is to account for the combined effects of mining and rainfall infiltration when assessing the stability of open-pit slopes, which can mitigate the failure risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The stability of rock slopes in open pit mines is crucial to the safe and efficient operation of a surface mine. When not planned for, rock slope failures can cause injuries, equipment damage or loss, delayed production schedule, and even loss of economic ore. Slope monitoring has emerged as a viable engineering tool to help mine operators better understand rock slope behaviour and response to mining activities and environmental conditions during the life of the mine. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of slope monitoring technologies with focus on the most recent development of Ground-Based interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-SAR). Discrete slope surface monitoring systems such as laser prism surveys and surface extensometers provide very accurate and precise point measurements. The data obtained from strategically placed discrete monitoring systems is generally sufficient to accurately describe simple, local failures. For large scale, complex failures however, monitoring systems that produce full-face scans such as radar are necessary. For the purpose of providing near real-time slope displacement data, the most suitable method is ground-based radar interferometry. High resolution, combined with large area coverage, thanks to the possibility of installing the radar at long distances from the slope, and short scan time, make GB-SAR one of the most effective slope monitoring technologies available today. In this paper, it is shown that the GB-SAR systemis able to timely detect and provide alarms on large scale slope movements for both gentle and steep slopes, as well as local scale movements at bench-scale which is equally important to the safety of mine operators at the work face. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {On 17 November 2016, an unexpected slope failure occurred in an undisclosed copper open-pit mine. The nature of the event urged for a thorough back-analysis of slope monitoring data in order to assess its size and temporal evolution, and to determine whether precursors potentially able to anticipate the failure were present. To this aim, satellite InSAR data spanning over the final 9 months before the event were, in retrospect, acquired and coupled with measurements from a ground-based radar that was in use at the time of the failure. Although progressive deformation was detected by the ground-based radar in correspondence of the two uppermost benches in the pit, the satellite InSAR data revealed that the vast majority of the instability actually involved a large part of natural slope above the mine crest. This sector was not visible by the ground-based radar. Thanks to the short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 mission, clear slope accelerating creep was observed for the first time in satellite InSAR measurements over an open-pit mine. The delimitation of the area featuring accelerating creep behavior matched remarkably the source area of the failure as mapped in the field after the event. Considerations on the volume of the instability and on the development of the failure process (both in space and time) were consequently derived. The results provided a clear example of the value of jointly using ground-based and satellite interferometry to reduce the uncertainties inherent to the identification and characterization of impending catastrophic slope failures. © 2018 The Authors},

Today, GBInSAR is used internationally as a leading-edge tool for near-real-time monitoring of surface slope movements in landslides and open pit mines. The success of the technology relies mainly on its ability to measure slope movements rapidly with sub-millimetric accuracy over wide areas and in almost any weather conditions. In recent years, GBInSAR has experienced significant improvements, due to the development of more advanced radar techniques in terms of both data processing and sensor performance. These improvements have led to widespread diffusion of the technology for early warning monitoring of slopes in both civil and mining applications. The main technical features of modern SAR technology for slope monitoring are discussed in this paper. A comparative analysis with other monitoring technologies is also presented along with some recent examples of successful slope monitoring. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

To date, early-warning has mostly relied on the availability of detailed, high-frequency data from sensors installed in situ. The same purpose could not be chased through spaceborne monitoring applications, as these could not yield information acquired in sufficiently systematic fashion. Here we present three sets of Sentinel-1 constellation images processed by means of multi-interferometric analysis. We detect clear trends of accelerating displacement prior to the catastrophic failure of three large slopes of very different nature: an open-pit mine slope, a natural rock slope in alpine terrain, and a tailings dam embankment. We determine that these events could have been located several days or weeks in advance. The results highlight that satellite InSAR may now be used to support decision making and enhance predictive ability for this type of hazard. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the last decade, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry – PSI have been largely employed to predict instabilities and failure in open pit mines. The PSI is a powerful technique, which combines radar satellite data in order to detect and monitor tiny surface displacements over vast areas. In the last years, the Sentinel-1 radar mission have produced images of the globe acquired with different spatial and temporal resolutions that are now freely available. In recent years, the footwall slopes of the Riacho dos Machados Gold Mine – MRDM (Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil) have recorded large planar failures controlled by foliation planes. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to evaluate a stack of 39 Interferometric Wide Sentinel-1 scenes, spanning from January 2018 to April 2019, acquired in descending orbit geometry, for the detection and monitoring of surface displacements. The results have shown that descending IW Sentinel-1 scenes can be used to provide a broad picture of the Line-Of-Sight-LOS deformation phenomena. In order to monitor the evolution of the deformation phenomena induced by mining activities, LOS deformation maps with millimeter accuracy could be only delivered at least every 12 days. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

	abstract = {The hydro-mechanical coupling in the shallow crust influences both geological processes such as earthquakes and landslides and anthropogenic processes such as induced seismicity and mining-produced subsidence. Yet there have been few direct field observation to illustrate how the hydraulic and the mechanical processes are coupled. In this study we use continuous water level data from wells and ground deformation data over a large area (>71 km2) of active coal mining in NW China to examine hydro-mechanical coupling in the shallow crust. We present detailed analysis of the tidal response of groundwater and surface deformation from radar remote sensing in an actively and intensely mined area, and we show that the phase shift of the tidal response of water level may respond significantly to mining disturbances when the excavation workface was many hundred meters to >1 km away, whereas significant ground deformation and water-level drops occurred only when the workface came much closer to the wells. Water level and tidal response recovered after the workface moved away but the subsidence is permanent. We suggest that the permeability of the mined crust may be controlled by narrow conductive fractures that open and close in response to deviatoric stresses, while large ground deformation and water-level drops may be controlled by larger fractures and faulting. One possibility is the release of the deviatoric stresses in the wall rocks by faulting, may have allowed the conductive fractures to close and the water level and its tidal response to recover after the workface moved away. Another possible mechanism is the mobilization of precipitates in clogged fractures by dynamic waves associated with mining-induced seismicity, which may change the permeability of fractures. More studies are warranted for a better understanding of the hydro-mechanical coupling during longwall mining. © 2020},

	abstract = {Ground-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (GB-InSAR) is a valuable tool for deformation monitoring. The 2D interferograms obtained by GB-InSAR can be integrated with a 3D terrain model to visually and accurately locate deformed areas. The process has been preliminarily realized by geometric mapping assisted by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). However, due to the line-of-sight (LOS) deformation monitoring, shadow and layover often occur in topographically rugged areas, which makes it difficult to distinguish the deformed points on the slope between the ones on the pavement. The extant resampling and interpolation method, which is designed for solving the scale difference between the point cloud and radar pixels, does not consider the local scattering characteristics difference of slope. The scattering difference information of road surface and slope surface in the terrain model is deeply weakened. We propose a differentiated method with integrated GB-InSAR and terrain surface point cloud. Local geometric and scattering characteristics of the slope were extracted, which account for pavement and slope differentiating. The geometric model is based on a GB-InSAR system with linear repeated-pass and the topographic point cloud relative observation geometry. The scattering model is based on k-nearest neighbor (KNN) points in small patches varies as radar micro-wave incident angle changes. Simulation and a field experiment were conducted in an open-pit mine. The results show that the proposed method effectively distinguishes pavement and slope surface deformation and the abnormal area boundary is partially relieved. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Time series dynamic prediction of surface deformation in mining areas can provide reference data for coal mine safety and production, which has important impacts. The combination of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology and the probability integral method (PIM) is commonly used for predicting deformation. However, most surface subsidence prediction in mining areas is based on the static PIM parameters, failing to achieve the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic deformation prediction. This paper proposed a 3D deformation dynamic prediction model (InSAR-3D-CTPIM) between InSAR deformation observations and dynamic coordinate-time PIM (CTPIM) parameters, which can realize the prediction of east–west, north–south, and vertical series deformation caused by mining. The method has been validated by simulation experiments and real experiments in the mining area of Jiansheng Coal Mine in Baisha Reservoir, Henan Province, China. The results showed that the modeling accuracy was improved by 34.3% compared to the traditional multi-rate model, and the accuracy was improved by 28.5% compared to the vertical deformation obtained by the traditional static PIM method. The InSAR-3D-CTPIM model can be used to predict the evolutionary history of basin-wide surface deformation dynamics in coal mining areas, and provide a reference for the early warning and prediction of geological hazards in coal mining areas. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Luanchuan mining area, which is located in Henan Province, China and characterized by undulating topography and large precipitation, is vulnerable to the landslide disasters. The observations from the space-borne radar (ascending and descending TerraSAR-X) images and the ground-based radar (GPRI-II) images are integrated to monitor the surface deformations in Luanchuan mining area. Before the integration of the observations from multi-source SAR images, the coordinate systems of multi-source images are required to be unified by geographical projection. However, the accuracy of the commonly used geographical coding will be degraded by external DEM errors and inaccurate satellite orbit, which makes it difficult to achieve the high-precision registration of space-borne and ground-based radar scenes. Therefore, in this paper the iterative closest point (ICP) method is introduced to register the space-borne and ground-based images, yielding sub-pixel registration accuracy. Reasonable weights are then assigned to multi-source observations through Strain Model and Variance Component Estimation (SM-VCE) method, from which the high-precision three-dimensional deformations can be reconstructed. The results show that the maximum deformation rates in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions of Luanchuan mining area from July 20, 2019, to August 1, 2019, are about 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 mm/day, respectively. The deformations are mainly on the loose slags in the Luanchuan pit rather than the bedrock, as a result of the accumulation of waste slags. Some suggestions on the installation location of ground-based radar are also provided to better combine the space-borne and ground-based observations. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Although the atmospheric compensation models developed to date have been generally robust and effective for InSAR, how to choose the right atmospheric correction method for ground-based InSAR is worth studying. This paper uses different methods for atmospheric phase screen (APS) compensation based on studies of ground-based radar (GBR) to zero-baseline acquisitions over the Woda landslide in Sichuan, China. This landslide has a steep topography, thick fog, turbulent rivers and strong rains. Data were acquired at the Ku-band using a GAMMA Portable Radar Interferometer II (GPRI-II) in multiple campaigns (4 July 2019–13 July 2019). In 2019, the Miyun open-pit mine was also studied; the maximum deformation reached 4.03 mm/hour. The collected data were processed within one unit based on the small baseline set (SBAS) approach. The experimental results show the following (1) For long-distance monitoring with complex atmospheric disturbances, range- and/or height-dependent models fail. (2) The iterative decomposition (ITD) method can effectively address complex atmospheric disturbances. (3) If the threshold of wavelength is set to be large, the ITD method becomes a stratified model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Slope failures pose a substantial threat to mining activity due to their destructive potential and high probability of occurrence on steep slopes close to limit equilibrium conditions, which are often found both in open pits and in waste and tailing disposal facilities. The development of slope monitoring and modeling programs usually entails the exploitation of in situ and remote sensing data, together with the application of numerical modeling, and it plays an important role in the definition of prevention and mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the impact of slope failures in mining areas. In this paper, a new methodology is presented; one that combines satellite radar interferometry and 2D finite element modeling for slope stability analysis at a regional scale, and applied within slope unit polygons. Although the literature includes many studies applying radar interferometry and modeling for slope stability analysis, the addition of slope units as input data for radar interferometry and modeling purposes has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. A former mining area in southeast Spain was studied, and the method proved useful for detecting and characterizing a large number of unstable slopes. Out of the 1959 slope units used for the spatial analysis of the radar interferometry data, 43 were unstable, with varying values of safety factor and landslide size. Out of the 43 active slope units, 21 exhibited line of sight velocities greater than the maximum error obtained through validation analysis (2.5 cm/year). Finally, this work discusses the possibility of using the results of the proposed approach to devise a proxy for landslide hazard. The proposed methodology can help to provide non-expert final users with intelligible, clear, and easily comparable information to analyze slope instabilities in different settings, and not limited to mining areas. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A 610-m-high portion of the South Wall of the Bingham Canyon open pit has experienced slow-moving slope deformations several times during spring melt until the movement was stabilized approximately 7 years ago. To develop and optimize life of mine slope designs, an understanding of the mechanism(s) and associated material strength parameters, was required. A back-analysis and calibration of the strength parameters for the salient rock mass and structural features was undertaken. The back-analysis consisted of understanding the conditions and trigger for the slope movement and adjusting strength parameters to match available monitoring data (time-domain reflectometer cables, inclinometers, interferometric radar data, etc.). The trigger for the movement was attributed to the spring high-perched water levels in the upper part of the wall. A FLAC3D model was built to back-analyze and capture the complex behavior of the slope during the high deformation period (August 2011). The back-analysis was consistent with the conceptual model and indicated that the slide was composed of mixed mechanisms, namely, a structurally controlled mechanism for the upper wall and a rock mass controlled mechanism for the lower wall (toe). The analysis supported by a converging FLAC3D model, were used to guide mining engineers in developing robust pit design in the South Wall. Today, the O-Slide instability is being fully managed by rigorous monitoring, implementation of a toe buttress, successful dewatering efforts, and unloading of the movement mass as another slice of mining advances down the South Wall. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A quarry failure along the slopes of the Wai Khar open-pit jade mine in Hpakant, Myanmar has led to the deaths of at least 172 jade miners on 2 July 2020. This paper conducts a systematic investigation of the incident by integrating data from multiple sensors, including high-resolution optical imagery, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, unmanned aerial system (UAS) footage, SRTM and ALOS digital elevation models (DEMs), soil moisture product from multi-spectral Landsat-8 satellite and precipitation records from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Optical imagery, UAS footage and DEMs allow us to build a comprehensive mapping of tailing areas and quarry scarps from 2010 and reconstruct the 2D pit geometry prior to failure. Deformation signals from multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), soil moisture variations and precipitation trends further allow us to identify possible failure causes. To evaluate the quality of deformation obtained from different distributed-scatterer phase estimators, we develop an empirical mapping function based on areal fraction values to facilitate the comparison of temporal coherence values that are differently formulated in each phase estimator. The comparison shows that phase linking algorithm outperforms the small baseline subset method in terms of signal recovery and phase reliability. Our investigation points out that the mining site is under aggressive mining cycles that are exacerbated by frequent, uncontrolled landslides. Seepage failure, which involves the expulsion of water from rapidly compacting tailings, may be a critical factor in the 2020 incident. Instead of extreme weather, the failure had occurred under normal to drier conditions. This means that the sliding planes were already in a critical state, which is evident from the accelerated deformation around the collapse area since the beginning of 2020. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve mining site regulations and management practices for safer open-pit mining in Myanmar and probably in similar contexts outside Myanmar. © 2021 The Author(s)},

This paper presents a newly proposed early warning time-of-failure (TOF) analysis procedure for use in real-time with ground-based radar measurements designed to be integrated in an open-pit mine’s trigger action response plan (TARP). The inverse-velocity and slope gradient (SLO) TOF analysis methods are applied to radar displacement measurements using a new systematic multi-pixel selection technique termed the “percent deformation method.” The utilization of the percent deformation method in the proposed real-time TOF analysis methodology gives more-reliable results than current practice by providing recommendations for pixel selections, data filtering, where and how to undertake TOF analyses, and presenting TOF results in real time. The addition of a more rigorous, methodical treatment of radar monitoring data when faced with critical slope instability will reduce uncertainty and increase confidence in any trigger action response decisions, helping to ensure a safer work environment. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

	abstract = {Ground-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (GB-InSAR) is a valuable technique for monitoring deformation of landslides. GB-InSAR can construct high-resolution 2D images in a range-doppler plane. However, it is difficult for geo-engineers who are unfamiliar with radar monitoring geometry to interpret the results. Geometric mapping method has been applied to the co-registration of terrain models and radar images for the deformation zonation, but the mismatching correction with GB-InSAR and terrain model is not fully investigated by existing researches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method exploiting an optimum linear transformation based on ground control points (GCPs). The proposed method was evaluated on simulated data and a field campaign in an open pit mine. The deformation mapping result of the method was verified by a collapse event. The method proposed in this paper has an RMSE value ranging from 0.502 to 0.720 m (@700 m average monitoring range) when the average density of the terrain point cloud is 0.5 m. Although this method cannot accurately evaluate the antenna footprint vector deflection parameters, it can meet the needs of coarse matching calibration in relatively flat slope sub-target areas of open-pit mines for engineering applications. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Landslide risks in open-pit mine areas are heightened by artificial slope modifications necessary for mining operations, endangering human life and property. On 22 February 2023, a catastrophic landslide occurred at the Xinjing Open-Pit Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia, China, resulting in 53 fatalities and economic losses totaling 28.7 million USD. Investigating the pre-, co-, and post-failure deformation processes and exploring the potential driving mechanisms are crucial to preventing similar tragedies. In this study, we used multi-source optical and radar images alongside satellite geodetic methods to analyze the event. The results revealed pre-failure acceleration at the slope toe, large-scale southward displacement during collapse, and ongoing deformation across the mine area due to mining operations and waste accumulation. The collapse was primarily triggered by an excessively steep, non-compliant artificial slope design and continuous excavation at the slope’s base. Furthermore, our experiments indicated that the commonly used Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) significantly underestimated landslide deformation due to the maximum detectable deformation gradient (MDDG) limitation. In contrast, the high-spatial-resolution Fucheng-1 provided more accurate monitoring results with a higher MDDG. This underscores the importance of carefully assessing the MDDG when employing InSAR techniques to monitor rapid deformation in mining areas. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Numerous open-pit mines are scattered within the southern mountainous areas of China. Due to the complex mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall, surface disturbances caused by open-pit mining activities pose a serious risk of landslides. To identify potential landslide hazards in mountainous open-pit mining areas in advance, this study proposes a quantitative method that utilizes ascending and descending orbit Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to accurately identify landslide hazards. We select the Xiaolongtan coal mining area in Yunnan, China, as a case study. Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology was employed to obtain the Line of Sight (LOS) deformation of ascending and descending orbits from November 2019 to November 2021. Following this, two-dimensional deformations were calculated based on the obtained LOS deformations. Multiple remote sensing data sources, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were utilized to extract potential landslide points based on vertical deformation. A combined subjective and objective weighting method was then used to assess the landslide hazard in the study area, and an information quantity model was constructed for landslide hazards in the mining area. Finally, based on high-resolution remote sensing images from the study period, potential landslide hazards were identified in the study area. The results reveal that the vertical deformation rate in the mining area ranges from − 231.73 to 81.42 mm/year, indicating significant subsidence and uplift tendencies. A total of 2353 potential landslide points were identified, primarily located near the slopes of two open-pit mines and in areas with low vegetation coverage. The Xiaolongtan and Buzhaoba open-pit mines, along with the surrounding regions in the study area, were identified to exhibit relatively high landslide hazards. Among the three coal mine waste dumps, the Beipingba waste dump presents a higher landslide hazard. This study provides a scientific basis and practical reference for identifying landslide hazards in mountainous open-pit mining areas. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},
